Version 5.0.0
-------------

:Date: May 12, 2020

This release includes two large changes, one that is breaking and requires a major version upgrade:

* We have removed our deprecated doc serving code that used ``core/views``, ``core/symlinks``, and ``builds/syncers`` (`#6535 <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/6535>`__). All doc serving should now be done via ``proxito``. In production this has been the case for over a month, we have now removed the deprecated code from the codebase.
* We did a large documentation refactor that should make things nicer to read and highlights more of our existing features. This is the first of a series of new documentation additions we have planned

Version 4.1.8
-------------

:Date: May 05, 2020

This release adds a few new features and bugfixes.
The largest change is the addition of ``hidden`` versions,
which allows docs to be built but not shown to users on the site.
This will keep old links from breaking but not direct new users there.

We've also expanded the CDN support to make sure we're passing headers on 3xx and 4xx responses.
This will allow us to expand the timeout on our CDN.

We've also updated and added a good amount of documentation in this release,
and we're starting a larger refactor of our docs to help users understand the platform better.

Version 4.1.7
-------------

:Date: April 28, 2020

As of this release, most documentation on Read the Docs Community is now behind Cloudflare's CDN.
It should be much faster for people further from US East.
Please report any issues you experience with stale cached documentation (especially CSS/JS).

Another change in this release related to how custom domains are handled.
Custom domains will now redirect HTTP -> HTTPS if the Domain's "HTTPS" flag is set.
Also, the subdomain URL (eg. ``<project>.readthedocs.io/...``) should redirect to the custom domain
if the Domain's "canonical" flag is set.
These flags are configurable in your project dashboard under :guilabel:`Admin` > :guilabel:`Domains`.

Many of the other changes related to improvements for our infrastructure
to allow us to have autoscaling build and web servers.
There were bug fixes for projects using versions tied to annotated git tags
and custom user redirects will now send query parameters.
