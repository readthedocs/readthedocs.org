Purpose
-------

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
It supports many documentation tools
(e.g. Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_, MkDocs_ docs written with markdown_, among others),
and can pull Git_ repositories.
We then automatically build your documentation and host it for you.

Read the Docs is designed for developers and teams who want to automate
the building, versioning, and hosting of documentation alongside their code.
It follows the “Docs as Code” philosophy, treating documentation with the same
care and workflow as source code.

Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*, or documentation as code.
