Purpose
-------

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
It supports many documentation tools
(e.g. Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_, MkDocs_ docs written with markdown_, among others),
and can pull Git_ repositories.
Then we build documentation and host it for you.
Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*, or Docs as Code.
