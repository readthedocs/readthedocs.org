# NOTE: we have to pin to this version because Celery>=5.3.x detects our ``ConfigError`` exception is not picklable
# and creates a ``UnpickleableExceptionWrapper`` which is not what our code expects.
# This may be due to a Python bug which can't pickle/unpickle the exception properly.
# We could consider either:
#  - handle ``UnpickleableExceptionWrapper`` in our code and inspect what's the inner exception
#  - find a way to disable pickling the exceptions
#  - make our custom exception picklable

# ...     super().__init__(a)
