# Used for Redis cache Django backend (`django.core.cache.backends.redis.RedisCache`)

# NOTE: we have to pin to this version because Celery>=5.3.x detects our ``ConfigError`` exception is not picklable
# and creates a ``UnpickleableExceptionWrapper`` which is not what our code expects.
# This may be due to a Python bug which can't pickle/unpickle the exception properly.
# We could consider either:
#  - handle ``UnpickleableExceptionWrapper`` in our code and inspect what's the inner exception
#  - find a way to disable pickling the exceptions
#  - make our custom exception picklable
#

# Reproducible example:
# >>> import pickle
# >>> class MyException(Exception):
# ...   def __init__(self, a, b):
# ...     self.a = a
# ...     self.b = b
# ...     super().__init__(a)
# ...
# >>> pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(MyException("a", "b")))
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: MyException.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'b'
