class TaskRouter:

    """
    Celery tasks router.

    It allows us to decide which queue is where we want to execute the task
    based on project's settings but also in queue availability.

    1. the project is using conda
    2. new project with less than N successful builds
    3. last N successful builds have a high time average

    It ignores projects that have already set ``build_queue`` attribute.
