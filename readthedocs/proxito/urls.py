"""
A quick rundown of all the URL's we are hoping to parse.

## Projects

pip.rtfd.io/<lang>/<version>/

* Can be single version (pip.rtfd.io/index.html)
* Can be translated (pip.rtfd.io/cz/latest/index.html)
* Can have subprojects (pip.rtfd.io/projects/foo/en/latest/index.html)

## Subprojects

pip.rtfd.io/projects/<slug>/

* Can be single version (pip.rtfd.io/projects/subproject/index.html)
* Can be translated (pip.rtfd.io/projects/subproject/cz/latest/index.html)
* Can't have subprojects (pip.rtfd.io/projects/foo/projects/bar/en/latest/index.html)

## Translations

pip.rtfd.io/<lang>/

* Must be served directly (pip.rtfd.io/cz/latest/index.html)
* Can't be single version (pip.rtfd.io/en/index.html)
    * TODO: Possibly support this, it seems reasonable
* Can't have subprojects (pip.rtfd.io/en/projects/foo/en/latestindex.html)
    * This would stop us from detaching translations from Project modeling
* Can't be translated (pip.rtfd.io/cz/en/latest/index.html)
