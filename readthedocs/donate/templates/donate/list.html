  <h2>About Read the Docs</h2>

  <p>
    Read the Docs has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/readthedocs.org">grown substantially</a>
    since its beginning as a weekend project.
    Today, we:
  </p>

  <ul class="donate-about">
    <li>Serve over <b>20 million pages</b> of documentation a month</li>
    <li>Have 10 servers and serve over <b>2 TB</b> of documentation a month</li>
    <li>Host over <b>18,000 projects</b> and support <b>25,000 users</b></li>
    <li>Are supported by two dedicated engineers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We host projects from all languages and programming communities.
    Some examples of projects that we host include:
  </p>

  <ul class="donate-about">
    <li><a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">Pip</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Sublime Text Community Docs</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Bootstrap Datepicker</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.3/">Julia</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Doctrine ORM</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/">Sequelize</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because of the growth and popularity of the service, the associated
    technical and operational support demands a good deal of labor.
    Where development can be sustained with community contributions,
    consistent support for users, maintenance, and on-call procedures
    require accountability and dedicated engineers.
    These types of roles are hard to accomplish on a volunteer basis.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make sure these roles were filled, we decided to treat the project as
    a job &ndash; we formed a company and dedicated ourselves full-time to
    the project.
    Now, we would like to make sure that the service is <b>sustainable</b>
    and its costs are covered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>We are asking for your contributions to ensure continued operational
      and technical support for our community, as well as continued
      development.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Our primary goal is to cover the costs of supporting and maintaining
    Read the Docs for the <b>next three months</b>.
    We hope to account for the cost of at least one full-time engineer, 
    which, at the rate of $50/hour, would
    cost $24,000 over the next three months.
    Covering labor costs would allow us to spend time supporting the site
    instead of seeking income elsewhere.
