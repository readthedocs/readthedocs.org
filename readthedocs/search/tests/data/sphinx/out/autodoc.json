All three directives will by default only insert the docstring of the object itself: .. autoclass:: Noodle will produce source like this: .. class:: Noodle Noodle's docstring. The \u201cauto\u201d directives can also contain content of their own, it will be inserted into the resulting non-auto directive source after the docstring (but before any automatic member documentation). Therefore, you can also mix automatic and non-automatic member documentation, like so: .. autoclass:: Noodle :members: eat, slurp .. method:: boil(time=10) Boil the noodle *time* minutes. Options Options and advanced usage If you want to make the members option (or other options described below) the default, see autodoc_default_options. Tip You can use a negated form, 'no-flag', as an option of autodoc directive, to disable it temporarily. For example: .. automodule:: foo :no-undoc-members: Tip You can use autodoc directive options to temporarily override or extend default options which takes list as an input. For example: .. autoclass:: Noodle :members: eat :private-members: +_spicy, _garlickly Changed in version 3.5: The default options can be overridden or extended temporarily. autodoc considers a member private if its docstring contains :meta private: in its Info field lists. For example: def my_function(my_arg, my_other_arg): \"\"\"blah blah blah :meta private: \"\"\" New in version 3.0. autodoc considers a member public if its docstring contains :meta public: in its Info field lists, even if it starts with an underscore. For example: def _my_function(my_arg, my_other_arg): \"\"\"blah blah blah :meta public: \"\"\" New in version 3.1. autodoc considers a variable member does not have any default value if its docstring contains :meta hide-value: in its Info field lists. Example: var1 = None #: :meta hide-value: New in version 3.5. For classes and exceptions, members inherited from base classes will be left out when documenting all members, unless you give the inherited-members option, in addition to members: .. autoclass:: Noodle :members: :inherited-members: This can be combined with undoc-members to document all available members of the class or module. It can take an ancestor class not to document inherited members from it. By default, members of object class are not documented. To show them all, give None to the option. For example; If your class Foo is derived from list class and you don\u2019t want to document list.__len__(), you should specify a option :inherited-members: list to avoid special members of list class. Another example; If your class Foo has __str__ special method and autodoc directive has both inherited-members and special-members, __str__ will be documented as in the past, but other special method that are not implemented in your class Foo. Since v5.0, it can take a comma separated list of ancestor classes. It allows to suppress inherited members of several classes on the module at once by specifying the option to automodule directive. Note: this will lead to markup errors if the inherited members come from a module whose docstrings are not reST formatted. New in version 0.3. Changed in version 3.0: It takes an ancestor class name as an argument. Changed in version 5.0: It takes a comma separated list of ancestor class names. It\u2019s possible to override the signature for explicitly documented callable objects (functions, methods, classes) with the regular syntax that will override the signature gained from introspection: .. autoclass:: Noodle(type) .. automethod:: eat(persona) This is useful if the signature from the method is hidden by a decorator. New in version 0.4. The automodule, autoclass and autoexception directives also support a flag option called show-inheritance. When given, a list of base classes will be inserted just below the class signature (when used with automodule, this will be inserted for every class that is documented in the module). New in version 0.4. All autodoc directives support the noindex flag option that has the same effect as for standard py:function etc. directives: no index entries are generated for the documented object (and all autodocumented members). New in version 0.4. automodule also recognizes the synopsis, platform and deprecated options that the standard py:module directive supports. New in version 0.5. automodule and autoclass also has an member-order option that can be used to override the global value of autodoc_member_order for one directive. New in version 0.6. The directives supporting member documentation also have a exclude-members option that can be used to exclude single member names from documentation, if all members are to be documented. New in version 0.6. In an automodule directive with the members option set, only module members whose __module__ attribute is equal to the module name as given to automodule will be documented. This is to prevent documentation of imported classes or functions. Set the imported-members option if you want to prevent this behavior and document all available members. Note that attributes from imported modules will not be documented, because attribute documentation is discovered by parsing the source file of the current module. New in version 1.2. Add a list of modules in the autodoc_mock_imports to prevent import errors to halt the building process when some external dependencies are not importable at build time. New in version 1.3. As a hint to autodoc extension, you can put a :: separator in between module name and object name to let autodoc know the correct module name if it is ambiguous. .. autoclass:: module.name::Noodle autoclass also recognizes the class-doc-from option that can be used to override the global value of autoclass_content.

The no-value option can be used instead of a blank annotation to show the type hint but not the value: .. autodata:: CD_DRIVE :no-value: If both the annotation and no-value options are used, no-value has no effect. For module data members and class attributes, documentation can either be put into a comment with special formatting (using a #: to start the comment instead of just #), or in a docstring after the definition. Comments need to be either on a line of their own before the definition, or immediately after the assignment on the same line. The latter form is restricted to one line only.

Warning autodoc imports the modules to be documented. If any modules have side effects on import, these will be executed by autodoc when sphinx-build is run. If you document scripts (as opposed to library modules), make sure their main routine is protected by a if __name__ == '__main__' condition. For this to work, the docstrings must of course be written in correct reStructuredText. You can then use all of the usual Sphinx markup in the docstrings, and it will end up correctly in the documentation. Together with hand-written documentation, this technique eases the pain of having to maintain two locations for documentation, while at the same time avoiding auto-generated-looking pure API documentation.
