        Teams allow you to <b>group organization members together</b>,
        and <b>limit access</b> to projects inside your organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have created two teams for you:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Read Only</b> - who will only be able to read documentation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Admins</b> - who will be able to administer the full projects.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
