We've had a request from one of our users for the project name {{proj_name}} on Read the Docs. You are the current owner, and we wanted to reach out to you in accordance with our Abandoned Project policy (http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abandoned-projects.html).

Please reply at hello@readthedocs.com either allowing or disallowing the transfer of the name on Read the Docs within 6 weeks, otherwise we will take the action of *initiating the transfer to a new owner* by default.
