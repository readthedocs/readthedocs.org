      Read the Docs is an open source project.
      In order to maintain service, we rely on both the
      support of our users, and from sponsor support.

      We will periodically run advertisements on built documentation pages for
      sponsors, however we have strict guidelines on advertisements:
    {% endblocktrans %}

  <ul class="project-ads-guidelines">
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        We don't give sponsors access to user information
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        We only report the number of impressions and number of ad clicks
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        We only allow and image and text, no Javascript besides our existing

      If you do not wish to support Read the Docs with use of this ad space,
      we ask that you help support Read the Docs in one of following ways:

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        If you have an open source project, and can contribute financially,
        consider a gold subscription. Gold subscribers can disable ads for
        projects they author.

        If your project is an open source project, you most certainly also
        lack funding.  If you can't contribute financially to Read the Docs,
        consider donating your time. We can always use help with support
        requests, documentation updates, and of course feature development.

        If you are part of a company that uses Read the Docs to host
        documentation for a commercial product, we offer paid plans that
        offer email support, additional build resources, and features like
        CDN support and private documentation.

  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      If you can't contribute your support for your open source project, but
      are conflicted by allowing support through advertising, we still would
      like to give you the option to disable showing promotions inside your
      documentation. We might be in contact in the future to see if you would
      reconsider offering your support.

  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      If you are a company hosting commercial documentation on our community
      site, but can't offer support for Read the Docs, we do not allow
      removing sponsor advertisements on your documentation. This goes
      against the spirit of supporting the open source community, please find
      a way to offer your support.
