    Earlier this month we began the last phase of a project to retire our
    original user interface and replace it with a completely new dashboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Documentation hosted on <a href="https://readthedocs.com">Read the Docs Business</a>
    will display this new dashboard in several places where documentation
    readers interact with our application: documentation authentication and our
    default documentation error pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is a summary of what is changing, however we cover what will be
    changing and when to expect these changes in more detail on our website:
  </p>

      Rollout of our new dashboard
    </a>
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    On <strong>Dec 10th</strong> we will make our new dashboard the default
    dashboard for users logging into <a href="https://readthedocs.com">Read the Docs Business</a>
    from our website. This change will mainly affect project maintainers,
    especially maintainers that have not yet switched to the new dashboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this same time, we will also begin using the new dashboard for
    documentation authentication and documentation error pages. Documentation
    readers will notice the new dashboard as they log in to view private
    documentation and might notice updated error pages if they encounter an
    HTTP error.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>There will be no changes to user generated documentation
    otherwise.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Projects can update to use these new pages in their documentation at
    any point. If you would like to update your project to use these pages
    before then, <a href="https://app.readthedocs.com/support">contact us</a>.
