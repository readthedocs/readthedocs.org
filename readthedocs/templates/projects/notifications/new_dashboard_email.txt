Earlier this month we began the last phase of a project to retire our
original user interface and replace it with a completely new dashboard.

Documentation hosted on Read the Docs Business will display this new dashboard
in several places where documentation readers interact with our application:
documentation authentication and our default documentation error pages.

Below is a summary of what is changing, however we cover what will be
changing and when to expect these changes in more detail on our website:

  Rollout of our new dashboard
  https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2024/11/rollout-of-our-new-dashboard/

----

On *Dec 10th* we will make our new dashboard the default dashboard for
users logging into Read the Docs Business from our website.
This change will mainly affect project maintainers,
especially maintainers that have not yet switched to the new dashboard.

At this same time, we will also begin using the new dashboard for
documentation authentication and documentation error pages.
Documentation readers will notice the new dashboard as they log in to
view private documentation and might notice updated error pages if they
encounter an HTTP error.

*There will be no changes to user generated documentation otherwise.*

Projects can update to use these new pages in their documentation at any
point. If you would like to update your project to use these pages
before then, contact us:
