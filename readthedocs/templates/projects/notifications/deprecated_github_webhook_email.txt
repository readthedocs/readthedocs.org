Your project, {{ project.name }}, is still configured to use GitHub Services to trigger builds on Read the Docs.
Effective January 31, 2019, GitHub stopped processing requests using the Services feature,
and so Read the Docs no longer receives notifications on updates to your repository.

To continue building your Read the Docs project on changes to your repository,
you will need to add a new webhook on your GitHub repository.
You can either connect your GitHub account and configure a GitHub webhook integration,
or you can add a generic webhook integration.

You can find more information on our webhook intergrations in our documentation, at:

https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/webhooks.html#webhook-github-services
