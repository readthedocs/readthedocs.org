Your project "{{ project.slug }}" is not using a <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html">.readthedocs.yaml configuration file</a> and <strong>builds will stop working soon</strong>.

Configuration files will <strong>soon be required</strong> by projects, and will no longer be optional.
You will need to add a configuration file to your project to ensure your project continues building successfully.

Get in touch with us <a href="{{ production_uri }}{% url 'support' %}">via our support</a>
and let us know if you are unable to use a configuration file for any reason.
