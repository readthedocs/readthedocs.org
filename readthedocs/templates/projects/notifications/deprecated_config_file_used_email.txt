The Read the Docs build system will start requiring a configuration file v2 (.readthedocs.yaml) starting on September 25, 2023.
We are scheduling brownout days to provide extra reminders by failing build without a configuration file v2 during some hours before the final day.
Keep these dates in mind to avoid unexpected behaviours:

* Monday, July 24, 2023: Do the first brownout (temporarily enforce this deprecation) for 12 hours: 00:01 PST to 11:59 PST (noon)
* Monday, August 14, 2023: Do a second brownout (temporarily enforce this deprecation) for 24 hours: 00:01 PST to 23:59 PST (midnight)
* Monday, September 4, 2023: Do a third and final brownout (temporarily enforce this deprecation) for 48 hours: 00:01 PST to 23:59 PST (midnight)
* Monday, September 25, 2023: Fully remove support for building documentation without configuration file v2.

We have identified the following projects where you are admin are impacted by this deprecation:

{% for project in object %}
* {{ project.slug }}
{% endfor %}

You require to add a configuration file to your projects to ensure they continues building successfully and stop receiving these notifications.

For more information on how to create a required configuration file, see:

Get in touch with us at {{ production_uri }}{% url 'support' %}
and let us know if you are unable to use a configuration file for any reason.
