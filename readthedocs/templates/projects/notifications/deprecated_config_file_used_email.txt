Your project "{{ project.slug }}" is not using a .readthedocs.yaml configuration file (https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html) and will stop working soon.

Configuration files will soon be required by projects, and will no longer be optional.
You will need to add a configuration file to your project to ensure your project continues building successfully.

Get in touch with us at {{ production_uri }}{% url 'support' %}
and let us know if you are unable to use a configuration file for any reason.
