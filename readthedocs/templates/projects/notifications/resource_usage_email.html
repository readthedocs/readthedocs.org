<p>Just a heads up, builds for the project {{ project.name }} are failing
due to high resource usage.</p>

<p>Common reasons for high resource usage include importing extraneous modules or modules that require a compilation step, a problem with your Sphinx configuration resulting in high memory usage or an endless loop, or having a large documentation set.</p>

<p>Because Read the Docs is a free, shared resource, we must put resource limits on build processes in order to maintain fair queueing for all projects. We are happy to raise limits on your project, but please consider donating to Read the Docs, either financially or with your time.</p>
