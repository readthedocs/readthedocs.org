Your project, {{ project.name }}, is currently using a legacy incoming webhook to trigger builds on Read the Docs.
Effective April 1st, 2019, Read the Docs will no longer accept incoming webhooks through these endpoints.

To continue building your Read the Docs project on changes to your repository,
you will need to configure a new webhook with your VCS provider.
You can find more information on how to configure a new webhook in our documentation, at:

https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/webhooks.html#webhook-deprecated-endpoints
