    Make sure your project has a <code>.readthedocs.yaml</code> at the root of your repository. This file is required by Read the Docs to be able to build your documentation. You can <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html">read more about this in our documentation</a>.

<p class="info">
    Here you have an example for a Sphinx project:

    <code><pre>
# .readthedocs.yaml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Set the version of Python and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.11"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    # nodejs: "19"
    # rust: "1.64"
    # golang: "1.19"

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
   configuration: docs/conf.py

# If using Sphinx, optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF
# formats:
#    - pdf

# Optionally declare the Python requirements required to build your docs
python:
   install:
   - requirements: docs/requirements.txt
    </pre></code>
