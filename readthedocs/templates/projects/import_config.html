<p class="info">
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Make sure your project has a <code>.readthedocs.yaml</code> at the root of your repository. This file is required by Read the Docs to be able to build your documentation. You can <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html">read more about this in our documentation</a>.

<p class="info">
    Here you have an example for a common Sphinx project:

    <pre class="small">
        <code># .readthedocs.yaml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Set the OS, Python version and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.11"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    # nodejs: "19"
    # rust: "1.64"
    # golang: "1.19"

# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
   configuration: docs/conf.py

# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
# formats:
#    - pdf
#    - epub

# Optionally, but recommended, declare the Python requirements required to build your documentation
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
# python:
#    install:
#    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt</code>
    </pre>
