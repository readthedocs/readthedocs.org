    This is used for extension points in the code, where we want to extend a
    class without monkey patching it. This abstract class allows for lazy
    inheritance, creating a class from the specified class or from a setting,
    but only once the class is called.

    Default to an instance of the class defined by :py:cvar:`_default_class`.

    Next, look for an override setting class path in
    ``settings.CLASS_OVERRIDES``, which should be a dictionary of class paths.
    The setting should be a dictionary keyed by the object path name::

        CLASS_OVERRIDES = {
            'readthedocs.core.resolver.Resolver': 'something.resolver.Resolver',
        }

    Lastly, if ``settings.CLASS_OVERRIDES`` is missing, or the key is not found,
    attempt to pull the key :py:cvar:`_override_setting` from ``settings``.
