class FilteredModelChoiceFilter(ModelChoiceFilter):

    """
    A model choice field for customizing choice querysets at initialization.

    This extends the model choice field queryset lookup to include executing a
    method from the parent filter set. Normally, ModelChoiceFilter will use the
    underlying model manager ``all()`` method to populate choices. This of
    course is not correct as we need to worry about permissions to organizations
    and teams.

    Using a method on the parent filterset, the queryset can be filtered using
    attributes on the FilterSet instance, which for now is view time parameters
    like ``organization``.

    Additional parameters from this class:

    :param queryset_method: Name of method on parent FilterSet to call to build
                            queryset for choice population.

    Django-filter filterset mixin class for context data.

    Django-filter gives two classes for constructing views:

    - :py:class:`~django_filters.views.BaseFilterView`
    - :py:class:`~django_filters.views.FilterMixin`

    These aren't quite yet usable, as some of our views still support our legacy
    dashboard. For now, this class will aim to be an intermediate step. It will
    expect these methods to be called from ``get_context_data()``, but will
    maintain some level of compatibility with the native mixin/view classes.

        directly to the ``FilterSet.__init__``.
