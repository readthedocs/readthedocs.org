"""
Doc serving from Python.

In production there are two modes,
* Serving from public symlinks in nginx (readthedocs.org & readthedocs.com)
* Serving from private symlinks in Python (readthedocs.com only)

In development, we have two modes:
* Serving from public symlinks in Python
* Serving from private symlinks in Python

This means we should only serve from public symlinks in dev,
and generally default to serving from private symlinks in Python only.

Privacy
-------

These views will take into account the version privacy level.

Settings
--------

PYTHON_MEDIA (False) - Set this to True to serve docs & media from Python
SERVE_DOCS (['private']) - The list of ['private', 'public'] docs to serve.
