# Action to run pip-compile weekly and create a Pull Request with the changes.
# Althought GitHub says that pip-compile is supported by dependabot, we couldn't make it work together.
# That's why this action exists.
# If we ever find the proper configuration for dependabot+pip-compile,
# we can delete this action.
