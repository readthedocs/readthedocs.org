Subprojects
===========

We support the concept of Subprojects.
If you add a subproject to a project,
that documentation will also be served under the parent project's subdomain.

For example,
Kombu is a subproject of celery,
so you can access it on the `celery.readthedocs.io` domain:

http://celery.readthedocs.io/projects/kombu/en/latest/

This also works the same for CNAMEs:

http://docs.celeryproject.org/projects/kombu/en/latest/

You can add subprojects in the Admin section for your project.
