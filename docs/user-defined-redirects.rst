User-defined Redirects
======================

You can set up redirects for a project on the project's Admin page.

Prefix Redirects
----------------

The most useful and requested feature of redirects was when migrating to Read the Docs from an old host.
You would have your docs served at a previous URL,
but that URL would break once you moved them.
Read the Docs includes a language and version slug in your documentation,
but not all documentation is hosted this way.

Say that you previously had your docs hosted at ``http://docs.example.com/dev/``,
you move ``docs.example.com`` to point at Read the Docs.
So users will have a bookmark saved to a page at ``http://docs.example.com/dev/install.html``.

You can now set a *Prefix Redirect* that will redirect all 404's with a prefix to a new place.
The example configuration would be::

    Type: Prefix Redirect
    From URL: /dev/

Your users query would now redirect in the following manner::

	docs.example.com/dev/install.html ->
	docs.example.com/en/latest/install.html

Where ``en`` and ``latest`` are the default language and version values for your project.

Page Redirects
--------------

A more specific case is when you move a page around in your docs.
The old page will start 404'ing,
and your users will be confused.
*Page Redirects* let you redirect a specific page.

Say you move the ``example.html`` page into a subdirectory of examples: ``examples/intro.html``.
You would set the following configuration::

    Type: Page Redirect
    From URL: /example.html
    To URL: /examples/intro.html

Note that the ``/`` at the start doesn't count the ``/en/latest``, 
but just the user-controlled section of the URL.

Exact Redirects
---------------

If you're redirecting from an old host AND you aren't maintaining old paths for your
documents, a Prefix Redirect won't suffice and you'll need to create *Exact Redirects*
to redirect from a specific URL, to a specific page.

Say you're moving ``docs.example.com`` to Read the Docs and want to redirect traffic
from an old page at ``http://docs.example.com/dev/install.html`` to a new URL
of ``http://docs.example.com/en/latest/installing-your-site.html``.

The example configuration would be::

    Type: Exact Redirect
    From URL: /dev/install.html
    To URL:   /en/latest/installing-your-site.html

Your users query would now redirect in the following manner::

	docs.example.com/dev/install.html ->
	docs.example.com/en/latest/installing-your-site.html

Note that you should insert the desired language for "en" and version for "latest" to
achieve the desired redirect.

Sphinx Redirects
----------------

We also support redirects for changing the type of documentation Sphinx is building.
If you switch between *HTMLDir* and *HTML*, your URL's will change.
A page at ``/en/latest/install.html`` will be served at ``/en/latest/install/``,
or vice versa.
The built in redirects for this will handle redirecting users appropriately. 

Implementation
--------------

Since we serve documentation in a highly available way,
we do not run any logic when we're serving documentation.
This means that redirects will only happen in the case of a *404 File Not Found*.

In the future we might implement redirect logic in Javascript,
but this first version is only implemented in the 404 handlers.
