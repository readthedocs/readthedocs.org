Advertising
===========

Advertising is the single largest source of funding for Read the Docs.
It allows us to:

.. Updated: June 2018

- Serve over **35 million pages** of documentation a month
- Serve over **2 TB** of documentation a month
- Host over **80,000 open source projects** and support over **100,000 users**
- Pay a :doc:`small team <../team>` of dedicated full-time staff

Many advertising models involve tracking users around the internet,
selling their data, and privacy intrusion in general.
Instead of doing that, we built an :doc:`Ethical Advertising <ethical-advertising>` model
that respects user privacy.

We recognize that advertising is not for everyone.
You may :ref:`opt out of paid advertising <advertising/ethical-advertising:Opting Out>`
-- you will still see :ref:`community ads <advertising/ethical-advertising:Community Ads>` --
or you can `go ad-free`_ by donating to Read the Docs
or `becoming a Gold Member`_.
