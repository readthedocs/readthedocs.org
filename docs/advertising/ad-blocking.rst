Ad blocking
===========

Ad blockers fulfill a legitimate need
to mitigate the significant downsides of advertising
from tracking across the internet,
security implications of third-party code,
and impacting the UX and performance of sites.

At Read the Docs, we specifically didn't want those things.
That's why we built the our :doc:`Ethical Ad initiative <ethical-advertising>`
with only relevant, unobtrusive ads that respect your privacy
and don't do creepy behavioral targeting.

Advertising is the single largest source of funding for Read the Docs.
To keep our operations sustainable, we ask that you either
:ref:`allow our Ethical Ads <advertising/ad-blocking:Allowing Ethical Ads>`
or :ref:`go ad-free <advertising/ad-blocking:Going ad-free>`.


Allowing Ethical Ads
--------------------

If you use AdBlock or AdBlockPlus
and you allow `acceptable ads`_ or `privacy-friendly acceptable ads`_
then you're all set.
Advertising on Read the Docs complies with both of these programs.

If you prefer not to allow acceptable ads
but would consider allowing `ads that benefit open source`_,
please consider subscribing to either the wider **Open Source Ads list**
or simply the **Read the Docs Ads list**.

* `Setup for AdBlock`_
* `Setup for AdBlockPlus`_
* `Setup for uBlock Origin`_

.. note::

    Because of the way Read the Docs is structured
    where docs are hosted on many different domains,
    adding a normal ad block exception
    will only allow that single domain not Read the Docs as a whole.

Statistics and data
-------------------

It can be really hard to find good data on ad blocking.
In the spirit of transparency,
here is the data we have on ad blocking at Read the Docs.

* `32% of Read the Docs users use an ad blocker <https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-and-adblocking/>`_
* Of those, `a little over 50% allow acceptable ads <https://blog.readthedocs.com/ad-blocker-update/>`_
* Read the Docs users running ad blockers click on ads at about the same rate
  as those not running an ad blocker.
* Comparing with our server logs,
  roughly 28% of our hits did not register a Google Analytics (GA) pageview
  due to an ad blocker, privacy plugin, disabling JavaScript, or another reason.
* Of users who do not block GA,
  about 6% opt out of analytics on Read the Docs by enabling
  :ref:`Do Not Track <privacy-policy:Do Not Track>`.
