Design proposal for sphinxcontrib-query
=======================================

JQuery is being removed from Sphinx 6.0.0. We can expect 6.0.0 to ship in late 2023. See also:

* https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7405
* https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10070

This is a "request for comments" for initiating a community-owned Sphinx extension
that bundels jQuery.
