Roadmap
=======

Process
-------

We publicly organize our product roadmap, on our `GitHub Roadmap`_.
Here, you will find several views into our roadmap:

`Current sprint <https://github.com/orgs/readthedocs/projects/156/views/1>`_
    Work that core team is currently responsible for.

`Backlog <https://github.com/orgs/readthedocs/projects/156/views/4>`_
    Work that we have planned for future sprints. Items with an assigned
    timeframe have generally been discussed already by the team. Items that do
    not yet have a timeframe assigned are not yet a priority of the core team.

The focus of the core team will be on roadmap and sprint items. These items are
promoted from our backlog before each sprint begins.

Triaging issues for the Roadmap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues are triaged before they are worked on, involving a number of steps that
are covered in :doc:`/contribute`. Everyone can take part in helping to
triage issues, read more in :ref:`contribute:Triaging issues`. Additionally, issues are
considered for the Roadmap according to the following process:

* New issues coming in will be triaged, but won't yet be considered part of our
  roadmap.
* If the issue is a valid bug, it will be assigned the ``Accepted`` label and
  will be prioritized, likely on an upcoming release.
* If the issues are a feature or improvement, the issue might go through a design
  decision phase before being accepted and assigned to our roadmap. This is a
  good time to discuss how to address the problem technically. Skipping this
  phase might result in your PR being blocked, sent back to design decision, or
  perhaps even discarded. It's best to be active here before submitting a PR for
  a feature or improvement.
* The core team will only work on accepted issues, and will give PR review
  priority to accepted roadmap/sprint issues. Pull requests addressing issues
  that are not on our roadmap are welcome, but we cannot guarantee review
  response, even for small or easy to review pull requests.

Where to contribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's best to pick off issues from our roadmap, and specifically from `our backlog`_,
to ensure your pull request gets attention. If you find an issue that is not
currently on our roadmap, we suggest asking about the priority of the issue. In
some cases, we might put the issue on our roadmap to give it priority.
