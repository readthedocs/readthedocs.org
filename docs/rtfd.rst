Configuration of the production servers
=======================================

This document is to help people who are involved in the production instance of Read the Docs running on readthedocs.org. It contains implementation details and useful hints for the people handling operations of the servers.

Deploying Code
--------------

This uses the ``fabfile.py`` located in the root of project.

Pushing code to servers. This updates code & media::

    fab push

Restart the webs::

    fab restart

Restart the build servers celery::

    fab celery

Deploying Nginx
---------------

This uses the fabfile located in ``deploy/fab/fabfile.py`` to deploy the nginx configs in ``deploy/nginx/``.

To update the nginx configs::

    fab nginx_configs 

To reload nginx after the configs have been updated::

    fab nginx_reload

Elastic Search Setup
--------------------

::

    from search.indexes import Index, PageIndex, ProjectIndex, SectionIndex
     
    # Create the index.
    index = Index()
    index_name = index.timestamped_index()
    index.create_index(index_name)
    index.update_aliases(index_name)
    # Update mapping
    proj = ProjectIndex()
    proj.put_mapping()
    page = PageIndex()
    page.put_mapping()
    sec = SectionIndex()
    sec.put_mapping()


Servers
-------
The servers are themed somewhere between Norse mythology and Final Fantasy Aeons. I tried to keep them topical, and have some sense of their historical meaning and their purpose in the infrastructure.
