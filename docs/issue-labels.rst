Overview of issue labels
========================

Here is a full list of labels that we use in the `GitHub issue tracker`_ and
what they stand for.

.. _GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues

*Bug*
    An issue describing unexpected or malicious behaviour of the
    readthedocs.org software.

*Community Effort*
    Tickets with this label are valid issues that the core team thinks are
    worth to fix or implement in the future. However the core team's resources
    are too scarce to address these issues. Tickets marked with this label
    are issues that the core team will **not** work on, but contributions
    from the community are very welcome.

*Design*
    Issues related to the UI of the readthedocs.org website.

*Enhancement*
    Feature requests and ideas about how to make readthedocs.org better in
    general will have this label.

*Feature Overview*
    Features that are too big to be tackled in one ticket are split up into
    multiple tickets. A feature overview ticket is then explaining the overarching
    idea. See the milestone of the feature overview ticket for all related
    tickets.

*Good First Bug*
    This label marks tickets that are easy to get started with. The ticket
    should be ideal for beginners to dive into the code base.

*High Priority*
    Tickets with this label should be resolved as quickly as possible.

*Mkdocs*
    Tickets that are related to the Mkdocs builder.

*Needed: design decision*
    Tickets that need a design decision are blocked for development until a
    project leader clarifies the way in which the issue should be approached.

*Needed: documentation*
    If an issue involves creating or refining documentation, this label will be
    assigned.

*Needed: more information*
    This label indicates that the issue has not enough information in order to
    decide on how to go forward. See the documentation about our :ref:`triage
    process <triage-not-enough-information>` for more information.

*Needed: patch*
    This label indicates that a patch is required in order to resolve the
    ticket. A fix should be proposed via a pull request on GitHub.

*Needed: tests*
    This label indicates that a better test coverage is required to resolve
    the ticket. New tests should be proposed via a pull request on GitHub.

*Operations*
    Tickets that require changes in the server infrastructure.

*PR: ready for review*
    Pull Requests that are considered complete. A review by at least one core
    developer is required prior to merging it.

*PR: work in progress*
    Pull Requests that are not complete yet. A final review is not possible
    yet, but every Pull Request is open for discussion.

*Sprintable*
    Sprintable are all tickets that have the right amount of scope to be
    handled during a sprint. They are very focused and encapsulated.

*Status: blocked*
    The ticket cannot be resolved until some other ticket has been closed.
    See the ticket's log for which ticket is blocking this ticket.

*Status: duplicate*
    See the ticket's log to find the original ticket that this one is a
    duplicate of.

*Status: invalid*
    A ticket is invalid if the reported issue cannot be reproduced.

*Status: rejected*
    A ticket gets rejected if the proposed enhancement is not in line with the
    overall goals of readthedocs.org.

*Support*
    Questions that needs answering but do not require code changes or issues
    that only require a one time action on the server will have this label.
    See the documentation about our :ref:`triage process
    <triage-support-tickets>` for more information.
