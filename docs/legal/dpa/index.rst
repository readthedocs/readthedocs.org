8. Security
-----------

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying
likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Read the
Docs shall, in relation to the Organization Data, maintain appropriate technical
and organizational security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or
accidental access, loss, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Organization
Data. In assessing the appropriate level of security, Read the Docs shall take
specifically into account the risks that are presented by Processing, in
particular from a Personal Data Breach. Upon request, Read the Docs shall
provide Organization with a summary of Read the Docs’s security policies
applicable to the Services.

9. Data Transfers
-----------------

Organization acknowledges and agrees that Read the Docs may access and Process
Personal Data on a global basis as necessary to provide the Services in

transferred to and Processed by Read the Docs in the United States and to other
jurisdictions where Read the Docs’s Sub-Processors have operations.

10. Personal Data Breaches
--------------------------

If Read the Docs becomes aware of any Personal Data Breach involving
Organization Data, Read the Docs will promptly, and in no case more than five
calendar days after becoming aware, notify Organization in writing of the
Personal Data Breach. Following such notification, to the extent required by
applicable Data Protection Laws, Read the Docs will: (a) provide Organization
with timely information relating to such Personal Data Breach as it becomes
known or is reasonably requested by Organization; and (b) upon Organization’s
request, provide Organization with commercially reasonable assistance as
necessary to enable Organization to notify authorities and/or affected Data
Subjects. Each Party shall be solely responsible for all costs, damages, and
liabilities incurred as the result of a Personal Data Breach of the Party’s own
information system and shall, at the other Party’s request and cost, provide the
other Party with reasonable assistance to investigate, respond to, and mitigate
the effects of a Breach of the other Party’s information system.

11. Data Subject Requests
-------------------------

As part of the Services, Read the Docs provides Organization and with certain
controls by which the Organization may access, correct, delete, or restrict
Organization Data, which Organization may use to assist it in connection with
its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including its obligations relating
to responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under
applicable Data Protection Laws ("**Data Subject Requests**"). To the extent
that Organization is unable to independently address a Data Subject Request
through the Services, then upon Organization’s written request Read the Docs
shall provide reasonable assistance to Organization to respond to any Data
Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the
Processing of Organization Data under the Agreement. Organization shall
reimburse Read the Docs for the commercially reasonable costs arising from this
assistance. If a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the
Processing of Organization Data under the Agreement is made directly to Read the
Docs, Read the Docs will promptly inform Organization and will advise the Data
Subject to submit their request to Organization. Organization shall be solely
responsible for responding substantively to any such Data Subject Requests or
communications involving Personal Data.

12. Data Protection Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation
------------------------------------------------------------

To the extent Read the Docs is required under Data Protection Law, Read the Docs
shall (at Organization's expense) provide reasonably requested information
regarding Read the Docs’s processing of Organization Data under the Agreement to
enable Organization to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior
consultations with data protection authorities as required by law.

13. Deletion or Return of Personal Data
---------------------------------------

Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Read the Docs will delete or
return all Organization Data Processed pursuant to this DPA in accordance with
Organization’s reasonable Instructions. The requirements of this section shall
not apply to the extent that Read the Docs is required by Applicable Law to
retain some or all of the Organization Data, or to Organization Data Read the
Docs has archived on back-up systems, which data Read the Docs shall securely
isolate and protect from any further Processing and delete in accordance with
Read the Docs’s deletion practices.

14. Demonstration of Compliance
-------------------------------

Upon Organization's written request, Read the Docs shall make available to
Organization (on a confidential basis) all information reasonably necessary, and
allow for and contribute to audits, to demonstrate Read the Docs’s compliance
with this DPA, provided Organization shall not exercise this right more than
once per year. Organization shall take all reasonable measures to limit any
impact on Read the Docs by combining several information and/or audit requests
carried out on behalf of Organization in one single audit.

15. European Data
-----------------

This Section 15 applies only with respect to Processing of European Data by Read
the Docs.

a. **Roles of the Parties.** When Processing European Data under the
   Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Organization is
   the Controller and Read the Docs is the Processor.

b. **Sub-Processors.** In addition to the provisions of Section 7,
   Read the Docs will notify Organization of any changes to
   Sub-processors engaged to Process European Data by updating the
   Sub-Processor List and posting the changes for Organization’s
   review. Organization may object to the engagement of a new
   Sub-Processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of
   Personal Data within 30 days after posting the updated
   Sub-Processor List. If Organization so objects, the Parties will
   discuss Organization's concerns in good faith with a view to
   achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such
   resolution can be reached, Read the Docs will, at its sole
   discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit
   Organization to suspend or terminate the Agreement without
   liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees
   incurred by Organization prior to suspension or termination).

c. **Data Transfers.** In addition to Section 9, for transfers of
   European Personal Data to Read the Docs for processing by Read
   the Docs in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU,
   the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing
   “adequate” data protection, Read the Docs agrees it will (i) use
   the form of the Controller-to-Processor SCCs or (ii) provide at
   least the same level of privacy protection for European Personal
   Data as required under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield
   frameworks, as applicable. If such data transfers rely on
   Controller-to-Processor SCCs to enable the lawful transfer of
   European Personal Data, as set forth in the preceding sentence,
   the Parties agree that Data Subjects for whom Read the Docs
   Processes European Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries
   under the Controller-to-Processor SCCs. If Read the Docs is
   unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then
   (a) Read the Docs shall notify Organization of such inability and
   (b) any movement of European Personal Data to a non-EU country
   requires the prior written consent of Organization.

d. **Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultation with
   Supervisory Authorities.** To the extent that the required
   information is reasonably available to Read the Docs, and
   Organization does not otherwise have access to the required
   information, Read the Docs will provide reasonable assistance to
   Organization with any data protection impact assessments, and
   prior consultations with supervisory authorities or other
   competent data privacy authorities to the extent required by
   European Data Protection Laws.

16. California Personal Information
-----------------------------------

This Section 16 applies only with respect to Processing of California Personal
Information by Read the Docs in Read the Docs’s capacity as a Service Provider.

a. **Roles of the Parties.** When Processing California Personal
   Information in accordance with Organization's Instructions, the
   Parties acknowledge and agree that Organization is a Business and
   Read the Docs is the Service Provider for the purposes of the
   CCPA. Additionally, for the purposes of interpreting this DPA
   with respect to Processing of California Personal Information,
   the term “Controller” is replaced with “Business” and “Processor”
   is replaced with “Service Provider” wherever those terms appear
   in Sections 2 through 14 and Section 17 of this DPA.

b. **Responsibilities.** The Parties agree that Read the Docs will
   process Users’ California Personal Information as a Service
   Provider strictly for the business purpose of performing the
   Services under the Agreement and as set forth in Read the Docs’s
   Privacy Policy. The Parties agree that Read the Docs shall not
   (i) “sell” or “share” Users’ California Personal Information (as
   those terms are defined in the CCPA); (ii) retain, use, or
   disclose Users’ California Personal Information for a commercial
   purpose other than for such business purpose or as otherwise
   permitted by the CCPA; or (iii) retain, use, or disclose Users’
   California Personal Information outside of the direct business
   relationship between Organization and Read the Docs.

c. **Certification.** Read the Docs hereby certifies that it
   understands and will comply with the restrictions of Section
   16(b).

d. **No CCPA Sale.** The Parties agree that Organization does not
   sell California Personal Information to Read the Docs because, as
   a Service Provider, Read the Docs may only use California
   Personal Information for the purposes of providing the Services
   to Organization.

17. General
-----------

Organization represents that it is authorized to, and hereby agrees to, enter
into and be bound by this DPA for and on behalf of itself and each of its
affiliates and subsidiaries, thereby establishing a separate DPA between Read
the Docs and Organization and each of Organization’s affiliates and subsidiaries
subject to the Agreement, as applicable. The relationship between Parties is
that of independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be interpreted to
constitute the Parties as partners, joint venturers, principal-agent, or
otherwise participants in a common undertaking, or, except as expressly provided
herein, allow either Party to create or assume any obligation on behalf of the
other for any purpose whatsoever. The limitations of liability set forth in the
Agreement shall apply to Read the Docs’s liability arising out of or relating to
this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses (where applicable), taken in the
aggregate along with the Agreement and any other agreement between the Parties.
In case of any conflict or inconsistency with the terms of the Agreement, this
DPA shall take precedence over the terms of the Agreement to the extent of such
conflict or inconsistency. If any individual provisions of this DPA are
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of
the other provisions of this DPA shall not be affected. We periodically update
this Agreement. If you are a current Organization, you will be informed of any
modification by email, alert on the Organization dashboard or portal or by other
means.
