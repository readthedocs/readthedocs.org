DMCA Takedown Policy
====================

These are the guidelines that Read the Docs follows when handling DMCA takedown
requests and takedown counter requests. If you are a copyright holder wishing to
submit a takedown request, or an author that has been notified of a takedown
request, please familiarize yourself with `our process <Takedown Process_>`_.
You will be asked to confirm that you have reviewed information if you submit a
request or counter request.

We aim to keep this entire process as transparent as possible. Our process is
modeled after `GitHub's DMCA takedown process <github-dmca_>`_, which we
appreciate for its focus on transparency and fairness. All requests and counter
requests will be posted to this page below, in the `Request Archive`_. These
requests will be redacted to remove all identifying information, except for Read
the Docs user and project names.

Takedown Process
----------------

Here are the steps the Read the Docs will follow in the takedown request process:

Copyright holder submits a request
    This request, if valid, will be posted publicly on this page, `down below
    <Request Archive_>`_. The author affected by the takedown request will be
    notified with a link to the takedown request.

    For more information on submitting a takedown request, see: `Submitting a
    Request`_

Author is contacted
    The author of the content in question will be asked to make changes to the
    content specified in the takedown request. The author will have 24 hours to
    make these changes. The copyright holder will be notified if and when this
    process begins

Author acknowledges changes have been made
    The author must notify Read the Docs that changes have been made within 24
    hours of receiving a takedown request. If the author does not respond to this
    request, the default action will be to disable the Read the Docs project and
    remove any hosted versions

Copyright holder review
    If the author has made changes, the copyright holder will be notified of
    these changes. If the changes are sufficient, no further action is required,
    though copyright holders are welcome to submit a formal retraction. If the
    changes are not sufficient, the author's changes can be rejected. If the
    takedown request requires alteration, a new request must be submitted.  If
    Read the Docs does not receive a review response from the copyright holder
    within 2 weeks, the default action at this step is to assume the takedown
    request has been retracted.

Content may be disabled
    If the author does not respond to a request for changes, or if the copyright
    holder has rejected the author's changes during the review process, the
    documentation project in question will be disabled.

Author submits a counter request
    If the author believes their content was disabled as a result of a mistake,
    a counter request may be submitted. It would be advised that authors seek
    legal council before continuing. If the submitted counter request is
    sufficiently detailed, this counter will also be added to `this page
    <Request Archive_>`_. The copyright holder will be notified, with a link to
    this counter request.

    For more information on submitting a counter request, see: `Submitting a
    Counter`_

Copyright holder may file legal action
    At this point, if the copyright holder wishes to keep the offending content
    disabled, the copyright holder must file for legal action ordering the
    author refrain from infringing activities on Read the Docs. The copyright
    holder will have 2 weeks to supply Read the Docs with a copy of a valid legal
    complaint against the author. The default action here, if the copyright
    holder does not respond to this request, is to re-enable the author's
    project.
