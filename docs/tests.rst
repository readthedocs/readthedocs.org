Running tests
=============

Currently RTD isn't well tested. This is a problem, and it is being worked on. However, we do have a basic test suite. To run the tests, you need simply need to run::

    ./manage.py test rtd_tests

This should spit out a bunch of info, build a couple projects, and eventually pass.
