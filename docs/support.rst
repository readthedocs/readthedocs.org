Getting Help
------------

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the ``#readthedocs``
channel on Freenode_. We hang out there and you can get real-time help with
your projects.  The other good way is to open an issue on Github_.

.. _Freenode: irc://freenode.net/
.. _Github: http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

We are thinking about having some kind of Backwards
Incompatible Changes policy, much like the 1.0 of a code base, once we define
the redirects and interfaces that we wish to expose permanently.
