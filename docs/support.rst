Usage Questions
---------------

If you have questions about how to use Read the Docs, or have an issue that
isn't related to a bug, `Stack Overflow`_ is the best place to ask.  Tag
questions with ``read-the-docs`` so other folks can find them easily.

Good questions for Stack Overflow would be:

* "What is the best way to structure the table of contents across a project?"
* "How do I structure translations inside of my project for easiest contribution from users?"
* "How do I use Sphinx to use SVG images in HTML output but PNG in PDF output?"
