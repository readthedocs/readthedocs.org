Usage Questions
---------------

If you have questions about how to use Read the Docs, or have an issue that
isn't related to a bug, `Stack Overflow`_ is the best place to ask.  Tag
questions with ``read-the-docs`` so other folks can find them easily.

Good questions for Stack Overflow would be:

* "What is the best way to structure the table of contents across a project?"
* "How do I structure translations inside of my project for easiest contribution from users?"
* "How do I use Sphinx to use SVG images in HTML output but PNG in PDF output?"

Community Support
-----------------

Read the Docs is a community supported site,
nobody is paid to handle readthedocs.org support.
We are hoping to bring in enough money with our `Gold`_ program to change that,
so please sign up if you are able.

**All people answering your questions are doing it with their own time,
so please be kind and provide as much information as possible.**
