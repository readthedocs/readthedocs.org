Getting Help
=============

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the ``#rtd`` channel on
Freenode_. We hang out there and you can get real-time help with your projects.
The other good way is to open an issue on Github_.

The email at ReadTheDocs@readthedocs.org is also available for support.
