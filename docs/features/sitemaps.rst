Sitemaps
========

Sitemaps_ allows us to inform search engines about URLs that are available for crawling
and communicate them additional information about each URL of the project:

* when it was last updated,
* how often it changes,
* how important it is in relation to other URLs in the site, and
* what translations are available for a page.

Read the Docs automatically generates a sitemap for each project that hosts
to improve results when performing a search on these search engines.
This allow us to prioritize results based on the version number, for example
to show ``latest`` as the top result followed by ``stable`` and then all the project's
versions sorted following semver_.
