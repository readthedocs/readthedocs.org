The Story of Read the Docs
==========================

Writing documentation is hard. So is finding the right documentation.
`Read the Docs`_ was created to make documentation simple.

Read the Docs was started with several main goals in mind. The first goal was
to encourage people to write documentation, by removing the barrier of entry to
hosting. The other goal was to create a central platform for people to find
documentation. Having a shared platform for all documentation allows for
innovation at the platform level, allowing work to be done once and benefit
everyone.

`Documentation matters`_, but its often overlooked. We think that we can help a
documentation culture flourish, in open source communities and in enterprise.
Great projects, such as Django_ and SQLAlchemy_, and projects from companies
like Mozilla_, are already using Read the Docs to serve their documentation to
the world.
