Info about custom installs
==========================

Read the Docs is open source, which means you can run your own version of it.
There are many reasons to do this, the main one being if you want a private instance.
If you have to keep everything behind a firewall or VPN, this is for you.

If your main reasons for considering a custom installation
are to connect to private repositories or to have fine grained access control over your documentation,
please consider :doc:`Read the Docs for Business </commercial/index>`.
It has those features and more!
