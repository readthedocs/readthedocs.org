Guides for documentation authors
--------------------------------

These guides offer some tips and tricks to author documentation
with the tools supported on Read the Docs.
Only reStructuredText or Markdown knowledge
and minimal configuration tweaking are needed.

For an introduction to Sphinx and Mkdocs,
have a look at our :doc:`/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx`
and :doc:`/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs`.
