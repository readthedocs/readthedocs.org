Enabling Google Analytics on your Project
=========================================

Read the Docs has native support for Google Analytics.
You can enable it by:

* Going to **Admin > Advanced Settings** in your project.
* Fill in the **Analytics code** heading with your Google Tracking ID (example `UA-123456674-1`)

Once your documentation rebuilds it will include your Analytics tracking code and start sending data.
Google Analytics usually takes 60 minutes,
and sometimes can take up to a day before it starts reporting data.
