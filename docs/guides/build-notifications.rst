Enabling Build Notifications
============================

Read the Docs allows you to configure emails that can be sent on failing builds.
This makes sure you know when your builds have failed.

Take these steps to enable build notifications:

* Going to **Admin > Notifications** in your project.
* Fill in the **Email** field under the **New Email Notifications** heading
* Submit the form

You should now get notified when your builds fail!
