Alternate Domains
=================

Read the Docs supports a number of custom domains for your convenience. Shorter urls make everyone happy, and we like making people happy!

Subdomain Support
------------------

Every project has a subdomain that is available to serve it's documentation. If you go to <slug>.readthedocs.org, it should show you the latest version of documentation. A good example is http://pip.readthedocs.org

.. note:: If you have an old project that has an underscore (_) in the name, it will use a subdomain with a hypen (-).
          `RTFD 1035 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035>`_ has more information on valid subdomains.

CNAME Support
-------------

If you have your own domain, you can still host with us. If you point a CNAME record in your DNS to the subdomain for your project, it should magically serve your latest documentation on the custom domain. Using pip as another example, http://www.pip-installer.org resolves, but is hosted on our infrastructure.

As an example, fabric's dig record looks like this::

    -> dig docs.fabfile.org
    ...
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    docs.fabfile.org.   7200    IN  CNAME   fabric.readthedocs.org.

CNAME SSL
---------

We don't support SSL for CNAMEs on our side,
but you can enable support if you have your own server.
SSL requires having a secret key,
and if we hosted the key for you,
it would no longer be secret.

To enable SSL:

* Have a server listening on 443 that you control
* Add a domain that you wish to point at Read the Docs
* Enable proxying to us, with a custom ``X-RTD-SLUG`` header

An example nginx configuration for pip would look like:

.. code-block:: nginx
   :emphasize-lines: 9

    server {
        server_name docs.pip-installer.org;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://pip.readthedocs.org:80;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto http;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
            proxy_set_header X-RTD-SLUG pip;
            proxy_connect_timeout 10s;
            proxy_read_timeout 20s;
        }
    }

rtfd.org
---------

You can also use `rtfd.org` as a short URL for Read the Docs. For example, http://pip.rtfd.org redirects to its documentation page. Any use of `rtfd.org` will simply be redirected to `readthedocs.org`.
