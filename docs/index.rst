Welcome to Read The Docs
========================

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
It supports Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_, and can pull
from your Subversion_, Bazaar_, Git_, and Mercurial_ repositories.
The code is open source, and `available on github`_.

.. _Read the docs: http://readthedocs.org/
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. _reStructuredText: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html
.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _Bazaar: http://bazaar.canonical.com/
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/
.. _available on github: http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org

The documentation for the site is organized into two different sections below. One is for users of readthedocs.org, that is the first section. The next section is for users of the code that powers the site. All of the RTD code is open source, so you can run your own instance. Presumably in an internal install inside your company, or something.
