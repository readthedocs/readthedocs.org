   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Read The Docs's
==========================

This is a site devoted to the hosting of documentation for the open source
community. It currently supports sphinx documentation, written in
`reStructuredText format <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_.  We can pull
your existing docs if they're hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket, or you can
create documentation using our reSt editor.


Why readthedocs.org?
--------------------

Our aim is to make it easy for open source developers to host their projects'
documentation!  I hope you like it.
