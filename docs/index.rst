Welcome to Read The Docs's
==========================

This is a site devoted to the hosting of documentation for the open source
community. It currently supports sphinx documentation, written in
`reStructuredText format <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_.

We support Svn, Bzr, Git, and Hg repositories, which will be auto-updated with
post commit hooks for your documentation.


The code is hosted on github at http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org and is
fully open source. We hope you choose to help us on the project!


Why readthedocs.org?
--------------------

Our aim is to make it easy for open source developers to host their projects'
documentation!  I hope you like it.
