Analytics
---------


.. note:: These features are still being developed, and aren't deployed yet.

Analytics lets you see *who* is viewing *which* documents.
This allows you to understand how your documentation is being used,
so you can focus on expanding and updating parts people are reading most.


Viewing
~~~~~~~

Each project page has a listing of the number of views that it has seen.
You can click through here to inspect more information about who is viewing,
and when they are looking at things.

You can also view your Analytics data in your documentation pages.
There is a button in the Read the Docs flyout what will overlay analytics information.
This will let you understand how users are using docs,
in context of the actual documentation.
