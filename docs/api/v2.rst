API v2
======

The Read the Docs API uses :abbr:`REST (Representational State Transfer)`.
JSON is returned by all API responses including errors
and HTTP response status codes are to designate success and failure.

.. note::

    A newer API v3 is in early development stages.
    Some improvements coming in v3 are:

    * Search API
    * Write access
    * Simpler URLs which use slugs instead of numeric IDs
    * Improved error reporting

    If there are features you would like in v3, please get in touch
    in the `issue tracker <https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues>`_.


Authentication and authorization
--------------------------------

Requests to the Read the Docs public API are for public information only
and do not require any authentication.


Resources
---------

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Projects are the main building block of Read the Docs.
Projects are built when there are changes to the code
and the resulting documentation is hosted and served by Read the Docs.

As an example, this documentation is part of the `Docs project`_
which has documentation at https://docs.readthedocs.io.

You can always view your Read the Docs projects in your `project dashboard`_.

.. _Docs project: https://readthedocs.org/projects/docs/
.. _project dashboard: https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/

Versions
~~~~~~~~

Versions are different versions of the same project documentation

The versions for a given project can be viewed in a project's version screen.
For example, here is the `Pip project's version screen`_.

Builds
~~~~~~

Builds are created by Read the Docs whenever a ``Project`` has its documentation built.
Frequently this happens automatically via a web hook but can be triggered manually.

Builds can be viewed in the build screen for a project.

Undocumented resources and endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some undocumented endpoints in the API.
These should not be used and could change at any time.
These include:

* The search API (``/api/v2/search/``)
* Endpoints for returning footer and version data to be injected into docs.
  (``/api/v2/footer_html``)
* Endpoints used for advertising (``/api/v2/sustainability/``)
* Any other endpoints not detailed above.
