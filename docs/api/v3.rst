API v3
======

The Read the Docs API uses :abbr:`REST (Representational State Transfer)`.
JSON is returned by all API responses including errors
and HTTP response status codes are to designate success and failure.

.. warning::

   APIv3 is currently under development and it's not ready to use yet.


Authentication and authorization
--------------------------------

Requests to the Read the Docs public API are for public and private information.
Some listing endpoints and some detailed ones are allowed to access without being authenticated.
Although, all endpoints that perform non-readonly operations, require authentication.


No authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some endpoints on read-only requests won't require any kind of authentication.
Most of them are detailed information of specific listings for a particular object.


Token
~~~~~

The ``Authorization`` HTTP header can be specified with a ``Token`` to authenticate as a user
and have the same permissions that the user itself.


Session
~~~~~~~

Session authentication is allowed on very specific endpoints,
to allow hitting the API when reading documentation.

When a user is trying to authenticate via session,
:abbr:`CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)` check is performed.

Builds

Builds are created by Read the Docs whenever a ``Project`` has its documentation built.
Frequently this happens automatically via a web hook but can be triggered manually.
