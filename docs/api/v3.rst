API v3
======

The Read the Docs API uses :abbr:`REST (Representational State Transfer)`.
JSON is returned by all API responses including errors
and HTTP response status codes are to designate success and failure.

.. warning::

   APIv3 is currently under development and it's not ready to use yet.


Authentication and authorization
--------------------------------

Requests to the Read the Docs public API are for public and private information.
All endpoints require authentication.


Token
~~~~~

The ``Authorization`` HTTP header can be specified with a ``Token`` to authenticate as a user
and have the same permissions that the user itself.


Session
~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Authentication via session is not enabled yet.

Session authentication is allowed on very specific endpoints,
to allow hitting the API when reading documentation.

When a user is trying to authenticate via session,
:abbr:`CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)` check is performed.
