Sponsors of Read the Docs
=========================

Running Read the Docs isn't free, and the site wouldn't be where it is today
without generous support of our sponsors. Below is a list of all the folks who
have helped the site financially, in order of the date they first started
supporting us.

Current sponsors
----------------

* `Rackspace`_ - They cover all of our hosting expenses every month.  This is a pretty large sum of money, averaging around $3,000/mo, and we are really grateful to have them as a sponsor.
* `Mozilla`_ - Mozilla has given us a `MOSS grant`_ for building specific features, and have funded Eric Holscher to work on Read the Docs at $1,000/mo for 2016.
* You? (Email us at rev@readthedocs.org for more info)
