Public
~~~~~~

This is the easiest and most obvious. It is also the default.
It means that everything is available to be seen by everyone.

Protected
~~~~~~~~~

Protected means that your object won't show up in Listing Pages,
but Detail pages still work. For example, a Project that is Protected will
not show on the homepage Recently Updated list, however,
if you link directly to the project, you will get a 200 and the page will display.

Protected Versions are similar, they won't show up in your version listings,
but will be available once linked to.


Private
~~~~~~~

Private objects are available only to people who have permissions so see them.
They will not display on any list view, and will 404 when you link them to others.
