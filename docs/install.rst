Installation
=============

Installing RTD is pretty simple. Here is a step by step plan on how to do it.

First, obtain Python_ and virtualenv_ if you do not already have them. Using a
virtual environment will make the installation easier, and will help to avoid
clutter in your system-wide libraries. You will also need Git_ in order to
clone the repository.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/

Once you have these, create a virtual environment somewhere on your disk, then
activate it::

    virtualenv rtd
    cd rtd
    source bin/activate

Create a folder in here, and clone the repository::

    mkdir checkouts
    cd checkouts
    git clone http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org.git

Next, install the dependencies using ``pip`` (included with virtualenv_)::

    cd readthedocs.org
    pip install -r pip_requirements.txt

This may take a while, so go grab a beverage. When it's done, build your
database::

    cd readthedocs
    ./manage.py syncdb

This will prompt you to create a superuser account for Django. Do that. Then::

    ./manage.py migrate

Go ahead and load in a couple users and a test projects::

    ./manage.py loaddata test_data

Finally, you're ready to start the webserver::

    ./manage.py runserver
 
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to see how it looks; you can use
the admin interface via http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin (logging in with the
superuser account you just created).

While the webserver is running, you can build documentation for a project with
the ``update_repos`` command::

   ./manage.py update_repos pip


Solr (Search) Setup
-------------------
Apache Solr is used to index and search documents. 

Additional python requirements necessary to use Solr::

    pip install pysolr
    pip install pyquery

Fetch and unpack Solr::

    curl -O http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/3.5.0/apache-solr-3.5.0.tgz
    tar xvzf apache-solr-3.5.0.tgz && SOLR_PATH=`pwd`/apache-solr-3.5.0/example

Generate the schema.xml file::

    ./manage.py build_solr_schema > $SOLR_PATH/solr/conf/schema.xml

Start the server::

    cd $SOLR_PATH && java -jar start.jar

Index the data::
    
    ./manage.py build_files # creates database objects referencing project files
    ./manage.py update_index

.. note::

    For production environments, you'll want to run Solr in a more permanent
    servelet container, such as Tomcat or Jetty. Ubuntu distributions include
    prepackaged Solr installations. Try ``aptitude install solr-tomcat`` or 
    ``aptitude install solr-jetty.``

    See /etc/[solr|tomcat6|jetty] for configuration options.  The ``schema.xml``
    file must be replaced with the version built by django-haystack.


What's available
----------------

After registering with the site (or creating yourself a superuser account),
you will be able to log in and view the `dashboard <http://readthedocs.org/dashboard/>`_

From the dashboard you can either create new documentation, or import your existing
docs provided that they are in a git or mercurial repo.


Creating new Docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the goals of `readthedocs.org <http://readthedocs.org>`_ is to make it
easy for any open source developer to get high quality hosted docs with great
visibility!  We provide a simple editor and two sample pages whenever
a new project is created.  From there its up to you to fill in the gaps - we'll
build the docs, give you access to history on every revision of your files,
and we plan on adding more features in the weeks and months to come.


Importing existing docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other side of `readthedocs.org <http://readthedocs.org>`_ is hosting the
docs you've already built.  Simply provide us with the clone url to your repo,
we'll pull your code, extract your docs, and build them!  We make available
a post-commit webhook that can be configured to update the docs on our site
whenever you commit to your repo, effectively letting you 'set it and forget it'.
