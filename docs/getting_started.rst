Getting Started
===============

This document will show you how to get up and running with Read the Docs.
You will have your docs imported on Read the Docs in 5 minutes,
displayed beautifully for the world.

If you are already using Sphinx or Markdown for your docs, skip ahead to
:ref:`import-docs`.

Write Your Docs
---------------

You have two options for formatting your documentation:

* :ref:`in-rst`
* :ref:`in-markdown`

.. _in-rst:

In reStructuredText
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is `a screencast`_ that will help you get started if you prefer.

Sphinx_ is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful documentation.
Assuming you have Python_ already, `install Sphinx`_::

    $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild

Create a directory inside your project to hold your docs::

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ mkdir docs

Run ``sphinx-quickstart`` in there::

    $ cd docs
    $ sphinx-quickstart

This quick start will walk you through creating the basic configuration; in most cases, you
can just accept the defaults. When it's done, you'll have an ``index.rst``, a
``conf.py`` and some other files. Add these to revision control.

Now, edit your ``index.rst`` and add some information about your project.
Include as much detail as you like (refer to the reStructuredText_ syntax
or `this template`_ if you need help). Build them to see how they look::

    $ make html

.. note:: You can use ``sphinx-autobuild`` to auto-reload your docs. Run ``sphinx-autobuild . _build_html`` instead.

Edit your files and rebuild until you like what you see, then commit your changes and push to your public repository.
Once you have Sphinx documentation in a public repository, you can start using Read the Docs.

.. _in-markdown:

In Markdown
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Markdown and reStructuredText in the same Sphinx project.
We support this natively on Read the Docs, and you can do it locally::

    $ pip install recommonmark

Then in your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from recommonmark.parser import CommonMarkParser

    source_parsers = {
        '.md': CommonMarkParser,
    }

    source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']

.. note:: Markdown doesn't support a lot of the features of Sphinx,
          like inline markup and directives. However, it works for
          basic prose content. reStructuredText is the preferred
          format for technical documentation, please read `this blog post`_
          for motivation.

.. _import-docs:

Import Your Docs
----------------

`Sign up`_ for an account on RTD, then `log in`_. Visit your dashboard_ and click
Import_ to add your project to the site. Fill in the name and description, then
specify where your repository is located. This is normally the URL or path name
you'd use to checkout, clone, or branch your code. Some examples:

* Git: ``http://github.com/ericholscher/django-kong.git``
* Subversion: ``http://varnish-cache.org/svn/trunk``
* Mercurial: ``https://bitbucket.org/ianb/pip``
* Bazaar: ``lp:pasta``

Add an optional homepage URL and some tags, then click "Create".

Within a few seconds your code will automatically be fetched from your public repository,
and the documentation will be built.
Check out our :doc:`builds` page to learn more about how we build your docs,
and to troubleshoot any issues that arise.

If you want to keep your code updated as you commit,
configure your code repository to hit our `Post Commit Hooks`_.
This will rebuild your docs every time you push your code.

We support multiple versions of your code. You can read more about how to use this well on our :doc:`versions` page.

If you have any more trouble, don't hesitate to reach out to us. The :doc:`support` page has more information on getting in touch.
