Localization of Documentation
=============================

.. note:: This feature only applies to Sphinx documentation. We are working to bring it to our other documentation backends.

Read the Docs supports hosting your docs in multiple languages.
There are two different things that we support:

* A single project written in another language
* A project with translations into multiple languages


Single project in another language
----------------------------------

It is easy to set the *Language* of your project.
On the project *Admin* page (or *Import* page),
simply select your desired *Language* from the dropdown.
This will tell Read the Docs that your project is in the language.
The language will be represented in the URL for your project.

For example,
a project that is in Spanish will have a default URL of ``/es/latest/`` instead of ``/en/latest/``.

.. note:: You must commit the ``.po`` files for Read the Docs to translate your documentation.

Project with multiple translations
----------------------------------

This situation is a bit more complicated.
To support this,
you will have one parent project and a number of projects marked as translations of that parent.
Let's use ``phpmyadmin`` as an example.

The main ``phpmyadmin`` project is the parent for all translations.
Then you must create a project for each translation,
for example ``phpmyadmin-spanish``.
You will set the *Language* for ``phpmyadmin-spanish`` to ``Spanish``.
In the parent projects *Translations* page,
you will say that ``phpmyadmin-spanish`` is a translation for your project.

This has the results of serving:

* ``phpmyadmin`` at ``http://phpmyadmin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/``
* ``phpmyadmin-spanish`` at ``http://phpmyadmin.readthedocs.io/es/latest/``

It also gets included in the Read the Docs flyout:

.. note::
    The default language of a custom domain is determined by the language of the
    parent project that the domain was configured on. See
    :doc:`custom_domains` for more information.

.. note:: You can include multiple translations in the same repository,
          with same ``conf.py`` and ``.rst`` files,
          but each project must specify the language to build for those docs.

.. note:: You can read :doc:`guides/manage-translations` to understand the whole process for a documentation with multiples languages in the same repository and how to keep the translations updated on time.
