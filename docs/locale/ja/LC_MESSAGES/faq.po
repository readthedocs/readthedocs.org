"Yes. One criticism of Sphinx is that its annotated docstrings are too dense "

"customized docstring styles that are simultaneously informative and legible."
" The `NumPy "

"and `Google <http://google-"
"styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`_"
" styles are two popular docstring formats.  Fortunately, the default Read "
"The Docs theme handles both formats just fine, provided your ``conf.py`` "
"specifies an appropriate Sphinx extension that knows how to convert your "
"customized docstrings.  Two such extensions are `numpydoc "
"<https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_ and `napoleon <http://sphinxcontrib-"
"napoleon.readthedocs.org>`_. Only ``napoleon`` is able to handle both "
"docstring formats. Its default output more closely matches the format of "
"standard Sphinx annotations, and as a result, it tends to look a bit better "
"with the default theme."
