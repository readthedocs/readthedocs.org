"import, we will create a ``latest`` version. This will point at the default "

"In the normal case, the ``latest`` version will always point to the most up "
"to date development code. If you develop on a branch that is different than "
"the default for your VCS, you should set the **Default Branch** to that "
"branch."

"If you have documentation changes on a **long-lived branch**, you can build "
"those too. This will allow you to see how the new docs will be built in this"
" branch of the code. Generally you won't have more than 1 active branch over"
" a long period of time. The main exception here would be **release "
"branches**, which are branches that are maintained over time for a specific "
"release number."
