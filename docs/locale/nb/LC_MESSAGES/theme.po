"By default, Read the Docs will use its own custom sphinx theme unless you "
"set one yourself in your ``conf.py`` file. Likewise, setting the theme to "
"``default`` will accomplish the same behavior. The theme can be found on "
"`github here`_ and is meant to work independently of Read the Docs itself if"
" you want to just use the theme locally."

"This `blog post`_ provides some info about the design, but in short, the "
"theme aims to solve the limitations of Sphinx's default navigation setup, "
"where only a small portion of your docs were accessible in the sidebar. Our "
"theme is also meant to work well on mobile and tablet devices."

"Currently the left menu will build based upon any ``toctree(s)`` defined in "

" your index.rst file the theme reverts to sphinx's usual local toctree which"
" is based upon the heading set on your current page."
