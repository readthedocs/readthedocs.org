msgid ""
"Issues with this label are issues that the core team has accepted on to the "
"roadmap. The core team focuses on accepted bugs, features, and improvements "
"that are on our immediate roadmap and will give priority to these issues. "
"Pull requests could be delayed or closed if the pull request doesn't align "
"with our current roadmap. An issue or pull request that has not been "
"accepted should either eventually move to an accepted state, or should be "
"closed. As an issue is accepted, we will find room for it on our roadmap, "
"either on an upcoming release (point release milestones), or on a future "
"milestone project (named milestones)."

msgid "*Bug*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../issue-labels.rst:21
msgid ""
"An issue describing unexpected or malicious behaviour of the readthedocs.org"
" software. A Bug issue differs from an Improvement issue in that Bug issues "
"are given priority on our roadmap. On release, these issues generally only "
"warrant incrementing the patch level version."

msgid "Issues related to the UI of the readthedocs.org website."

msgid "*Feature*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../issue-labels.rst:30
msgid ""
"Issues that describe new features. Issues that do not describe new features,"
" such as code cleanup or fixes that are not related to a bug, should "
"probably be given the Improvement label instead. On release, issues with the"
" Feature label warrant at least a minor version increase."

#: ../../issue-labels.rst:46
msgid ""
"An issue with this label is not a Bug nor a Feature. Code cleanup or small "

"for this label is that these issues have a lower priority on our roadmap "
"compared to issues labeled Bug, and aren't implementing new features, such "
"as a Feature issue might."
