"Read the Docs supports multiple versions of your repository. On the initial "
"import, we will create a ``latest`` version. This will point at the default "
"branch for your VCS control: ``master``, ``default``, or ``trunk``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../versions.rst:9
msgid ""
"We also create a ``stable`` version, if your project has any tagged "
"releases. ``stable`` will be automatically kept up to date to point at your "
"highest version."

#: ../../versions.rst:16
msgid ""
"In the normal case, the ``latest`` version will always point to the most up "
"to date development code. If you develop on a branch that is different than "
"the default for your VCS, you should set the **Default Branch** to that "
"branch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../versions.rst:21
msgid ""
"You should push a **tag** for each version of your project. These tags "
"should be numbered in a way that is consistent with `semantic versioning "
"<http://semver.org/>`_. This will map to your ``stable`` branch by default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../versions.rst:26
msgid ""
"We in fact are parsing your tag names against the rules given by `PEP 440`_."
" This spec allows \"normal\" version numbers like ``1.4.2`` as well as pre-"
"releases. An alpha version or a release candidate are examples of pre-"
"releases and they look like this: ``2.0a1``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../versions.rst:31
msgid ""
"We only consider non pre-releases for the ``stable`` version of your "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../versions.rst:34
msgid ""
"If you have documentation changes on a **long-lived branch**, you can build "
"those too. This will allow you to see how the new docs will be built in this"
" branch of the code. Generally you won't have more than 1 active branch over"
" a long period of time. The main exception here would be **release "
"branches**, which are branches that are maintained over time for a specific "
"release number."

#: ../../versions.rst:46
msgid ""
"Read the Docs supports two workflows for versioning: based on tags or "
"branches. If you have at least one tag, tags will take preference over "
"branches when selecting the stable version."

msgid "Redirects on root URLs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../versions.rst:53
msgid ""
"When a user hits the root URL for your documentation, for example "
"``http://pip.readthedocs.io/``, they will be redirected to the **Default "
"version**. This defaults to **latest**, but could also point to your latest "
"released version."

"This is a banner that appears on the top of every page of your docs that "
"aren't stable or latest. This banner has a text with a link redirecting the "
"users to the latest version of your docs."

"This feature is disabled by default on new projects, you can enable it in "
