"Single Version Documentation lets you serve your docs at a root domain. By "
"default, all documentation served by Read the Docs has a root of "
"``/<language>/<version>/``. But, if you enable the \"Single Version\" option"
" for a project, its documentation will instead be served at ``/``."

"Links generated on Read the Docs will now point to the proper URL. For "
"example, if pip was set as a \"Single Version\" project, then links to its "
"documentation would point to ``http://pip.readthedocs.io/`` rather than the "
"default ``http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/``."

"Documentation at ``/<language>/<default_version>/`` will still be served for"
" backwards compatibility reasons. However, our usage of :doc:`canonical` "
"should stop these from being indexed by Google."
