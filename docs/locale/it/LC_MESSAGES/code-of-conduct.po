"Like the technical community as a whole, the Read the Docs team and "
"community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all "
"over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including "
"mentorship, teaching, and connecting people."

"Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to "
"communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground "
"rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to "
"founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance."

"This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it "
"in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich "
"all of us and the technical communities in which we participate."

"This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Read the Docs "
"project. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, and any "
"other forums created by the project team which the community uses for "
"communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may"
" affect a person's ability to participate within them."

"**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports "
"people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited "

"**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn "
"will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users "
"and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when "
"making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might "
"not be communicating in someone else's primary language."

#: ../../code-of-conduct.rst:42
msgid ""
"**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement "
"is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience "
"some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn "
"into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where "
"people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of "
"the Read the Docs community should be respectful when dealing with other "
"members as well as with people outside the Read the Docs community."

"**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and "
"technical, happen all the time and Read the Docs is no exception. It is "
"important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. "
"Remember that we’re different. The strength of Read the Docs comes from its "
"varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people "
"have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why "
"someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that"
" it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead,"
" focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes."
