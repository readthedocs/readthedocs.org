"This only works for the root url, not for internal pages. It's designed to "
"redirect people from http://pip.readthedocs.org/ to the default version of "
"your documentation, since serving up a 404 here would be a pretty terrible "
"user experience. (If your \"develop\" branch was designated as your default "
"version, then it would redirect to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/develop.) "
"But, it's not a universal redirecting solution. So, for example, a link to "
"an internal page like http://pip.readthedocs.org/usage.html doesn't redirect"
" to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html."

"The reasoning behind this is that RTD organizes the URLs for docs so that "
"multiple translations and multiple versions of your docs can be organized "
"logically and consistently for all projects that RTD hosts. For the way that"
" RTD views docs, http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ is the root directory"
" for your default documentation in English, not http://pip.readthedocs.org/."
" Just like http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/develop/ is the root for your "
"development documentation in English."
