"Web hooks are pretty amazing, and help to turn the web into a push instead "
"of pull platform. We have support for hitting a URL whenever you commit to "
"your project and we will try and rebuild your docs. This only rebuilds them "
"if something has changed, so it is cheap on the server side. As anyone who "
"has worked with push knows, pushing a doc update to your repo and watching "
"it get updated within seconds is an awesome feeling."
