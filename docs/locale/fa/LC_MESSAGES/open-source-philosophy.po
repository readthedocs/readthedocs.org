"However, as a project there are things that we care about more than others. "
"We built Read the Docs to support documentation in the Open Source "
"community. The code is open for people to contribute to, so that they may "
"build features into https://readthedocs.org that they want. We also believe "
"sharing the code openly is a valuable learning tool, especially for "
"demonstrating how to collaborate and maintain an enormous website."

"originally support."
