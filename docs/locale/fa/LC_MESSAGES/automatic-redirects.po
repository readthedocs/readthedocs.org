"A link to the root of your documentation will redirect to the *default "
"version*, as set in your project settings. For example::"

"This only works for the root URL, not for internal pages. It's designed to "
"redirect people from http://pip.readthedocs.io/ to the default version of "
"your documentation, since serving up a 404 here would be a pretty terrible "
"user experience. (If your \"develop\" branch was designated as your default "
"version, then it would redirect to http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/develop.) "
"But, it's not a universal redirecting solution. So, for example, a link to "
"an internal page like http://pip.readthedocs.io/usage.html doesn't redirect "
"to http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html."

"The reasoning behind this is that RTD organizes the URLs for docs so that "
"multiple translations and multiple versions of your docs can be organized "
"logically and consistently for all projects that RTD hosts. For the way that"
" RTD views docs, http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ is the root directory "
"for your default documentation in English, not http://pip.readthedocs.io/. "
"Just like http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/develop/ is the root for your "
"development documentation in English."

"These \"implicit\" redirects are supported for legacy reasons. We will not "

"The main challenge of URL routing in Read the Docs is handling redirects "
"correctly. Both in the interest of redirecting older URLs that are now "
"obsolete, and in the interest of handling \"logical-looking\" URLs (leaving "
"out the lang_slug or version_slug shouldn't result in a 404), the following "
"redirects are supported::"

"You can link to a specific page and have it redirect to your default "

"Another way to handle this is the *latest* version. You can set your "
"``latest`` version to a specific version and just always link to latest."
