"Documenting projects is hard, hosting them shouldnâ€™t be. Read the Docs was "
"created to make hosting documentation simple."

"Read the Docs was `started`_ with a couple main goals in mind. The first "
"goal was to encourage people to write documentation, by removing the barrier"
" of entry to hosting. The other goal was to create a central platform for "
"people to find documentation. Having a shared platform for all documentation"
" allows for innovation at the platform level, allowing work to be done once "
"and benefit everyone."

"`Documentation matters`_, but its often overlooked. We think that we can "
"help a documentation culture flourish. Great projects, such as Django_ and "
"SQLAlchemy_, and projects from companies like Mozilla_, are already using "
"Read the Docs to serve their documentation to the world."

"The site has grown quite a bit over the past year. Our `look back at 2013`_ "
"shows some numbers that show our progress. The job isn't anywhere near done "
"yet, but it's a great honor to be able to have such an impact already."

"We plan to keep building a great experience for people hosting their docs "
