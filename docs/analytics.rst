Analytics
---------

Analytics lets you see *which* documents your users are reading.
This allows you to understand how your documentation is being used,
so you can focus on expanding and updating parts people are reading most.

To see a list of the top pages from the last month,
go to the :guilabel:`Admin` tab of your project,
and then click on :guilabel:`Traffic Analytics`.

You can also access to analytics data from :ref:`search results <server-side-search:analytics>`.

.. note::

   If you require more information about page views,
   you can use a solution like :doc:`Google Analytics </guides/google-analytics>`.
