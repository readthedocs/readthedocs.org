Sharing
-------

.. note:: This feature only exists on our Business offering at `readthedocs.com <https://readthedocs.com/>`_.

You can share your project with users outside of your company.
There are two way to do this:

* by sending them a *secret link*,
* by giving them a *password*.

These methods will allow them to view a specific project inside your company.

Enabling
~~~~~~~~

* Go into your *Project Admin* page and to the *Sharing* menu.
* Under the *Share with someone new* heading, select the way you prefer (secret link or password), add an expiration date and a *Description* so you remember who you're sharing it with.
* Click *Share!* to create.
* Get the info needed to share your documentation with other users:

  * If you have selected secret link, copy the link that is generated
  * In case of password, copy the link and password

* Give that information to the person who you want to give access.

.. note:: You can always revoke access in the same panel.

Effects
~~~~~~~

Secret Link
***********

Once the person you send the link to clicks the link,
they will have access to view your project.

Password
********

Once the person you send the link to clicks on the link, they will see
a *Authorization required* page asking them for the password you
generated. When the user enters the password, they will have access to
view your project.
