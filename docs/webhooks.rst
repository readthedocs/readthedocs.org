Webhooks
========

Web hooks are pretty amazing, and help to turn the web into a push instead of
pull platform. We have support for hitting a URL whenever you commit to your
project and we will try and rebuild your docs. This only rebuilds them if
something has changed, so it is cheap on the server side.

As anyone who has worked with push knows, pushing a doc update to your repo and
watching it get updated within seconds is an awesome feeling. If you're on
github, simply put ``http://readthedocs.org/github`` as a post-commit hook on
your project. Otherwise your project detail page has your post-commit hook on
it. It will look something along the lines of
``http://readthedocs.org/build/<pk>``
