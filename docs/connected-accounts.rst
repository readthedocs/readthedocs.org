Connecting Your Account
-----------------------

If you are going to import repositories from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab,
you should connect your Read the Docs account to your repository host first.
Connecting your account allows for:

* Easier importing of your repositories
* Automatically configure your repository :doc:`webhooks`
  which allow Read the Docs to build your docs on every change to your repository
* Log into Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab credentials

If you signed up or logged in to Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab
credentials, you're all done. Your account is connected.

To connect your unconnected account, go to your *Settings* dashboard
and select `Connected Services <https://readthedocs.org/accounts/social/connections/>`_.
From here, you'll be able to connect to your GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab
account. This process will ask you to authorize a connection to Read the Docs,
that allows us to read information about and clone your repositories.
