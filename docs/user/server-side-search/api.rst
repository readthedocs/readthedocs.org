Server Side Search API
======================

You can integrate our :doc:`server side search </server-side-search/index>` in your documentation by using our API.

If you are using :doc:`/commercial/index` you will need to replace
https://readthedocs.org/ with https://readthedocs.com/ in all the URLs used in the following examples.
Check :ref:`server-side-search/api:authentication and authorization` if you are using private versions.

API V3
------

.. http:get:: /api/v3/search/

   Return a list of search results for a project or subset of projects.
   Results are divided into sections with highlights of the matching term.

   .. Request

   :query q: Search query (see :doc:`/server-side-search/syntax`)
   :query page: Jump to a specific page
   :query page_size: Limits the results per page, default is 50

   .. Response

   :>json string type: The type of the result, currently page is the only type.
   :>json string project: The project object
   :>json string version: The version object
   :>json string title: The title of the page
   :>json string domain: Canonical domain of the resulting page
   :>json string path: Path to the resulting page
   :>json object highlights: An object containing a list of substrings with matching terms.
                             Note that the text is HTML escaped with the matching terms inside a <span> tag.
   :>json object blocks:

    A list of block objects containing search results from the page.
    Currently, there are two types of blocks:

    - section: A page section with a linkable anchor (``id`` attribute).
    - domain: A Sphinx :doc:`domain <sphinx:usage/restructuredtext/domains>`
      with a linkable anchor (``id`` attribute).


   **Example request**:

      .. code-tab:: python

         import requests
         URL = 'https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/search/'

         }
         response = requests.get(URL, params=params)
         print(response.json())

   **Example response**:

Migrating from API V2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using query arguments to specify the project
and version to search, you need to do it from the query itself,
this is if you had the following parameters:

- project: docs
- version: latest
- q: test

Now you need to use:

- q: project:docs/latest test

The response of the API is very similar to V2,
with the following changes:

- ``project`` is an object, not a string.
- ``version`` is an object, not a string.
- ``project_alias`` isn't present,
  it is contained in the ``project`` object.

When searching on a parent project,
results from their subprojects won't be included automatically,
to include results from subprojects use the ``subprojects`` paramater.

Authentication and authorization
--------------------------------

If you are using :ref:`private versions <versions:privacy levels>`,
users will only be allowed to search projects they have permissions over.
Authentication and authorization is done using the current session,
or any of the valid :doc:`sharing methods </commercial/sharing>`.

To be able to use the user's current session you need to use the API from the domain where your docs are being served
(``<you-docs-domain>/_/api/v3/search/``).
This is ``https://docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/_/api/v3/search/``
for the ``https://docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/`` project, for example.

API V2 (deprecated)
-------------------

.. note::

   Please use our :ref:`server-side-search/api:api v3` instead,
   see :ref:`server-side-search/api:migrating from api v2`.

.. http:get:: /api/v2/search/

   Return a list of search results for a project,
   including results from its :doc:`/subprojects`.
   Results are divided into sections with highlights of the matching term.

   .. Request

   :query q: Search query
   :query project: Project slug
   :query version: Version slug
   :query page: Jump to a specific page
   :query page_size: Limits the results per page, default is 50

   .. Response

   :>json string type: The type of the result, currently page is the only type.
   :>json string project: The project slug
   :>json string project_alias: Alias of the project if it's a subproject.
   :>json string version: The version slug
   :>json string title: The title of the page
   :>json string domain: Canonical domain of the resulting page
   :>json string path: Path to the resulting page
   :>json object highlights: An object containing a list of substrings with matching terms.
                             Note that the text is HTML escaped with the matching terms inside a <span> tag.
   :>json object blocks:

    A list of block objects containing search results from the page.
    Currently, there are two types of blocks:

    - section: A page section with a linkable anchor (``id`` attribute).
    - domain: A Sphinx :doc:`domain <sphinx:usage/restructuredtext/domains>`
      with a linkable anchor (``id`` attribute).
