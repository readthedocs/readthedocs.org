Read the Docs for Science
=========================

Documentation and technical writing are very broad terms that also include science publication and academic writing. This is not least because of the overlap between features needed for software documentation and academic writing. Here's a brief overview of some of the features that people in science and academic writing love about the tools that are used on Read the Docs:

🪄 Easy to use
  You don't have to be a programmer. Use familiar Markdown-derived syntax and write your formulars with Latex

🔣 Formulas and proofs
  Use symbols familiar from math and physics, build advanced proofs.

🧮 Results directly imported
  Your datasets and results can be directly imported in their latest versions.

📚 Cross-linking and bibliographies
  Links are verified and bibliography databases maintained directly as code in your git repository.

📜 Modern themes and classic PDF outputs
  Use the latest state-of-the-art themes for web and have PDFs and e-book formats automatically generated.

⚙️ Automatic builds
