Read the Docs for Science
=========================

Documentation and technical writing are broad fields that include many scientific activities.
This includes building publications, academic writing, educational resources, interactive data science, and data journalism.

Let's explore the overlap of features for software documentation and academic writing.
Here's a brief overview of some features that people in science and academic writing love about Read the Docs:

.. dropdown:: ü™Ñ Easy to use
    :open:

    You don't have to be a programmer. Use familiar Markdown-derived syntax and write your formulas with LaTeX.

    Get started already today:

      * All new to this? Take the official :external+jupyterbook:doc:`Jupyter Book Tutorial <start/your-first-book>`
      * Curious for practical code? See :doc:`/examples`
      * Familiar with Sphinx? See :doc:`/guides/jupyter`

.. dropdown:: üîã Batteries included: Graphs, computations, formulas, maps, diagrams and more

    Take full advantage of getting all the richness of Jupyter Notebook combined with Sphinx and the giant ecosystem of extensions for both of these.

    Here are some examples:

    * Use symbols familiar from math and physics, build advanced proofs.
    * Present results with plots, graphs, images and let users interact directly with your datasets and algorithms.
    * Graphs, tables etc. are computed when the latest version of your website is built. All code examples on your website are validated each time you build.

.. dropdown:: üìö Bibliographies and external links

    Maintain bibliography databases directly as code and have external links automatically verified.

    Using extensions for Sphinx such as the popular `sphinxcontrib-bibtex <https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/>`__ extension, you can maintain your bibliography with Sphinx directly or refer to entries ``.bib`` files, as well as generating entire Bibliography sections from those files.

.. dropdown:: üìú Modern themes and classic PDF outputs

    Use the latest state-of-the-art themes for web and have PDFs and e-book formats automatically generated.

    New themes are improving every day, and when you write documentation based on Jupyter Book and Sphinx, you will separate your contents and semantics from your presentation logic. This way, you can keep up with the latest theme updates or try new themes.

    Another example of the benefits from separating content and presentation logic: Your documentation also transforms into printable books and eBooks.

.. dropdown:: üìê Widgets, widgets and more widgets

    Design your science project's layout and components with widgets from a rich eco-system of Open Source extensions built for many purposes. Special widgets help users display and interact with graphs, maps and more. Several extensions are built and invented by the science community.

.. dropdown:: ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic builds

    Build and publish your project for every addition in Git. Preview changes via Pull Requests. Receive notifications when something is wrong. How does this work? Have a look at this video:

.. dropdown:: üí¨ Collaboration and community

    Easy access for readers to suggest changes via GitHub, GitLab etc.

.. dropdown:: üîé Search Engine Optimization

    Don't reinvent SEO: Have SEO handled jointly by the combined best-practices from Sphinx, its themes and Read the Docs hosting.

.. dropdown:: üå± Grow your own solutions

    The eco-system is Open Source and makes it accessible for anyone with Python skills to build their own extensions.

We want science communities to use Read the Docs and to be part of the documentation community üíû

Getting started: Jupyter Book
-----------------------------

.. Left this out:
.. Jupyter Book is a popular and well-supported platform for Read the Docs, and we aren't shy to call it the no. 1 documentation tool for science.
..
.. Creating and sharing *computational documents* has long been the goal of Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. They offer a simple, streamlined and document-centric experience.
..
.. TODO: Insert a screenshot with a caption linking to the Jupyter Book gallery?

:external+jupyterbook:doc:`Jupyter Book <intro>` on Read the Docs brings you the rich experience of computated `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__ documents built together with a modern documentation tool. The results are beautiful and automatically deployed websites, built with Sphinx and :doc:`Executable Book <executablebook:index>` + all the extensions available in this ecosystem.

Here are some popular activities that are well-supported by Jupyter Book:

* Publication
* Academic Courses and class-room activities
* Research projects
* Data science software documentation

On the Executable Book website, you can find :doc:`a gallery of solutions built with Jupyter Book <executablebook:gallery>`.

Examples and users
------------------

.. TODO: get the correct link for https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#sub-project-documentation

Read the Docs community for science is already big and keeps growing. The :doc:`Jupyter Project <jupyter:index>` itself and :doc:`the many sub-projects of Jupyter <jupyter:index>` are built and published with Read the Docs.
