Read the Docs for Science
=========================

Documentation and technical writing are broad fields that include many science activities - building publications, academic writing, educational resources and interactive data science and data journalism.

Let's explore the overlap between features needed for software documentation and for instance academic writing. Here's a brief overview of some of the features that people in science and academic writing love about the many tools used on Read the Docs:

🪄 Easy to use
  You don't have to be a programmer. Use familiar Markdown-derived syntax and write your formulas with LaTeX.
🔣 Formulas and proofs
  Use symbols familiar from math and physics, build advanced proofs.
🧮 Results directly imported
  Graphs, tables etc. are computed when the latest version of your website is built. Your results can be directly imported in their latest versions.
📐 Widgets, widgets and more widgets
  Design your science project's layout and components with widgets from a rich eco-system of Open Source extensions built for many purposes.
📊 Maps, graphs, plots and more
  Present results with plots, graphs, images and let users interact directly with your datasets and algorithms.
📚 Bibliographies and external links
  Maintain bibliography databases directly as code and have external links automatically verified.
📜 Modern themes and classic PDF outputs
  Use the latest state-of-the-art themes for web and have PDFs and e-book formats automatically generated.
⚙️ Automatic builds
  Build and publish your project for every addition in Git. Preview changes via Pull Requests. Receive notifications when something is wrong.
💬 Collaboration and community
  Easy access for readers to suggest changes via GitHub, GitLab etc.
🔎 Search Engine Optimization
  Don't reinvent SEO: Have SEO handled jointly by the combined best-practices from Sphinx, its themes and Read the Docs hosting.
🌱 Grow your own solutions
  The eco-system is Open Source and makes it accessible for anyone with Python skills to build their own extensions.

We want science communities to use Read the Docs and to be part of the documentation community 💞

Getting started: Jupyter Book
-----------------------------

.. Left this out:
.. Jupyter Book is a popular and well-supported platform for Read the Docs, and we aren't shy to call it the no. 1 documentation tool for science.
..
.. Creating and sharing *computational documents* has long been the goal of Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. They offer a simple, streamlined and document-centric experience.
..
.. TODO: Insert a screenshot with a caption linking to the Jupyter Book gallery?

:doc:`Jupyter Book <jupyterbook:intro>` on Read the Docs brings you the rich experience of computated `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__ documents built together with a modern documentation tool. The results are beautiful and automatically deployed websites, built with Sphinx and :doc:`Executable Book <executablebook:index>` + all the extensions available in this ecosystem. You even get PDF and eBook versions and since the code behind is managed via Git, all your readers can help you build it as (if you want).

Here are some popular activities that are well-supported by Jupyter Book:

* Publication
* Academic Courses and class-room activities
* Research projects
* Data science software documentation

On the Executable Book website, you can find :doc:`a gallery of solutions built with Jupyter Book <executablebook:gallery>`.

Examples and users
------------------

.. TODO: get the correct link for https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#sub-project-documentation

Read the Docs community for science is already big and keeps growing. The :doc:`Jupyter Project <jupyter:index>` itself and :doc:`the many sub-projects of Jupyter <jupyter:index>` are built and published with Read the Docs.
