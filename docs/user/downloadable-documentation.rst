Offline Formats
===============

Read the Docs supports building multiple offline formats:

* PDF
* ePub
* Zipped HTML

This means that every commit that you push will automatically update your these offline formats as well as your HTML.

Use cases
---------

This functionality is great for anyone who needs documentation when they aren't connected to the internet.
Users who are about to get on a plane can grab a PDF and have the entire doc set ready for their trip.

The other value is having the entire documentation in a single file.
You can send a user an email with a single PDF or ePub and they'll have all the docs in one place.
This is useful for archiving documentation, as well as distributing it in other scenarios.

Accessing offline formats
-------------------------

You can download offline formats in the :guilabel:`Project dashboard` > :guilabel:`Downloads`:
