Offline Formats
===============

Read the Docs supports building multiple offline formats:

* PDF
* ePub
* Zipped HTML

This means that every commit that you push will automatically update your offline formats as well as your documentation website.

Use cases
---------

This functionality is great for anyone who needs documentation when they aren't connected to the internet.
Users who are about to get on a plane can grab a PDF and have the entire doc set ready for their trip.

PDF versions are also helpful to automatically create printable versions of your documentation. 
Using Sphinx, 
the source of your documentation will be structured to support both online and offline formats. 
This means that a documentation project displayed as a website can be downloaded as a PDF, 
ready to be printed as a report or a book.

Many academic and scientific projects benefit from these additional formats.

The other value is having the entire documentation in a single file.
You can send a user an email with a single PDF or ePub and they'll have all the docs in one place.
This makes your documentation project easy to redistribute or archive. 
Your entire documentation can now be delivered as an email attachment, 
uploaded to an eReader,
or accessed and searched locally without online latency.
