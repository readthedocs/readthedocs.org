Read the Docs for Business subscription management
==================================================

We want to make it easy to manage your billing information.
You can manage or cancel subscriptions from the :guilabel:`Settings > Subscriptions` page of the :term:`dashboard`.

Managing your subscription
--------------------------

* Go to https://readthedocs.com/organizations/.
* Select your organization from this list.
* Select :guilabel:`Settings` at the top of the page.
* Select the :guilabel:`Subscription` tab on the left.
* Click :guilabel:`Manage Subscription`.

This action will take you to the Stripe billing portal where you can manage your subscription.

.. note::
    You will need to be an organization owner to view subscription information.
    If you do not have permission,
    you can ask one of your existing organization owners to make any required changes.

Cancelling your subscription
----------------------------

Cancelling your subscription can be done in the same way as the above instructions.
You will be billed for the remainder of the current billing period,
and then not charged again.

**We can not cancel subscriptions just by sending us an email,
as email is an insecure method of verifying a user's identity.**
If you email us about this,
we require you to verify your identity by logging into your Read the Docs account and submitting an official support request there.

Discounts & Credits
-------------------

We do not generally discount our software.
We provide a ad-supported service to the community with |org_brand|,
but we do have one standard discount that we offer.

Non-profit & Academic Organizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our community hosting,
provided for free and open source projects,
is generally where we recommend most academic projects to host their projects.
If you have constraints on how public your documentation can be,
our commercial hosting is probably a better fit.

We offer a 50% discount on our all of our commercial plans to certified academic and non-profit organizations.
Please contact :doc:`/support` to request this discount.
