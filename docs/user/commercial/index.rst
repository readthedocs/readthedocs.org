   Read the Docs Community and Business are a combined system:
   All features developed for community benefit the business solution, and a lot of solutions developed for Business
   are implemented for community

The following list is a high-level overview of the areas covered by Read the Docs for Business.
If you want exact details, please refer to the `pricing page <https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/>`__ of the public site.

Private repositories and private documentation
    The largest difference between the community solution and our commercial offering
    is the ability to connect to private repositories,
    to restrict documentation access to certain users,
    or to share private documentation via private hyperlinks.

Additional build resources
    Do you have a complicated build process that uses large amounts
    of CPU, memory, disk, or networking resources?
    Commercial subscriptions offer more resources
    which results in faster documentation build times.
    Resources can be increased further for very demanding projects.

Priority support
    We have a dedicated support team that responds to support requests during business hours.

Advertising-free
    All commercially hosted documentation is always ad-free.

Business features
    A number of extra features exist specifically for business needs, such as
    organization support with team management, single-sign on, and audit logging.
