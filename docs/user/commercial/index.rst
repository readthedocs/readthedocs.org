About |com_brand|
=================

.. this page is currently moving towards becoming "About Read the Docs for Business"
.. rather than an index of features.

We offer *|com_brand|*
for building and hosting commercial documentation.

Our commercial solutions are provided as a set of subscriptions that are paid and managed through an online interface.
In order to get started quickly and easily, a `trial option <https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/>`__ is provided free of charge.

Commercial documentation solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to providing the same features as |org_brand|,
commercial subscriptions to Read the Docs add additional features based on the same software platform but on a separate infrastructure.

   Read the Docs for Community and Business are a combined system:
   All features developed for community benefit the business solution, and a lot of solutions developed for business
   are implemented for community.

The following list is a high-level overview of the areas covered by |com_brand|.
If you want exact details, please refer to the `pricing page <https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/>`__ of the public site.

Private repositories and private documentation
    The largest difference between the community solution and our commercial offering
    is the ability to connect to private repositories,
    to restrict documentation access to certain users,
    or to share private documentation via private hyperlinks.

Additional build resources
    Do you have a complicated build process that uses large amounts
    of CPU, memory, disk, or networking resources?
    Commercial subscriptions offer more resources
    which results in faster documentation build times.
    Resources can be increased further for very demanding projects.

Priority support
    We have a dedicated support team that responds to support requests during business hours.

Advertising-free
    All commercially hosted documentation is always ad-free.

Business features
    A number of extra features exist specifically for business needs, such as
    organization support with team management, single-sign on, and audit logging.
