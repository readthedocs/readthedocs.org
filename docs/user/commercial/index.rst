Business hosting
================

.. this page is currently moving towards becoming "About Read the Docs for Business"
.. rather than an index of features.

We offer |com_brand| for building and hosting documentation for private repositories.

In order to get started quickly, you can start a `free 30-day trial <https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/>`__ to test out the platform.

Commercial documentation solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to providing the same features as |org_brand|,
commercial subscriptions to Read the Docs add additional features and run on separate infrastructure.

The following list is a high-level overview of the areas covered by |com_brand|.
If you want a full feature breakdown, please refer to our `pricing page <https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/>`__.

Private repositories and private documentation
    The largest difference between the community solution and our commercial offering
    is the ability to connect to private repositories,
    to restrict documentation access to certain users,
    or to share private documentation via private hyperlinks.

Priority support
    We have a dedicated support team that responds to support requests during business hours.

Advertising-free
    All commercially hosted documentation is always ad-free.

Business features
    Enjoy additional functionality specifically for larger organizations such as
    team management, single-sign on, and audit logging.
