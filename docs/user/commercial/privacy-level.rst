Project Privacy Level
---------------------

.. note::

   This feature only exists on `Read the Docs for Business <https://readthedocs.com/>`__.

By default, only users that belong to your organization can see the dashboard of your project and its builds.
If you want users outside your organization and anonymous users to be able to see the dashboard of your project,
and the build output of *public versions* you can set the privacy level of your project to ``Public``.

- Go the :guilabel:`Admin` tab of your project.
- Click on :guilabel:`Advanced Settings`.
- Change to :guilabel:`Privacy level` to `Public`.
