What is config-file/examples for?

We are collecting all examples of configurations used in documentation and on
the website here.

We are putting examples into subfolders and calling them `.readthedocs.yaml`
because each example might turn into a fully runnable example at some point.

Examples should ultimately be possible to install as Read the Docs projects
using a custom configuration file path.
