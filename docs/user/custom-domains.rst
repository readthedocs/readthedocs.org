Custom Domains
==============

Custom domains allow you to serve your documentation from your own domain.
This is great for maintaining a consistent brand for your documentation and application.

By default, your documentation is served from a Read the Docs :ref:`subdomain <hosting:subdomain support>` using the project's :term:`slug`:

* ``<slug>.readthedocs.io`` for |org_brand|
* ``<slug>.readthedocs-hosted.com`` for |com_brand|.

For example if you import your project and it gets the :term:`slug` ``example-docs``, it will be served from ``https://example-docs.readthedocs.io``.
