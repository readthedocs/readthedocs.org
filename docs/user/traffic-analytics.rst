Traffic analytics
=================

Read the Docs aggregates statistics about visits to your documentation.
This is mainly information about how often pages are viewed,
and which return a `404 Not Found` error code.

Traffic analytics let you see *which* documents your users are reading.
This allows you to understand how your documentation is being used,
so you can focus on expanding and updating parts people are reading most.

To see a list of the top pages from the last month,
go to the :guilabel:`Admin` tab of your project,
and then click on :guilabel:`Traffic analytics`.
