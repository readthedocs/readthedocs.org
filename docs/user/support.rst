Site support
============

Read the Docs offers support for projects on our :doc:`Read the Docs for Business </commercial/index>` and |org_brand| platforms.
We're happy to assist with any questions or problems you have using either of our platforms.

.. note::
   Read the Docs does not offer support for questions or problems with documentation tools or content.
   If you have a question or problem using a particular documentation tool,
   you should refer to :ref:`external resources <support:External resources>` for help instead.

Some examples of requests that we support are:

- "How do I transfer ownership of a Read the Docs project to another maintainer?"
- "Why are my project builds being cancelled automatically?"
- "How do I manage my subscription?"

You might also find the answers you are looking for in our :doc:`documentation guides </guides/index>`.
These provide step-by-step solutions to common user requests.
