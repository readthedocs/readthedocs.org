Build notifications via webhooks and email
==========================================

Build notifications can alert you when your documentation builds fail so you can take immediate action.
We offer the following methods for being notified:

Email notifications:
  Read the Docs allows you to configure build notifications via email.
  When builds fail,
  configured email addresses are notified.

Build Status Webhooks:
  Build notifications can happen via :term:`webhooks <webhook>`.
  This means that we are able to support a wide variety of services that receive notifications.

  Slack and Discord are supported through ready-made templates.

  Webhooks can be customized through your own template and a variety of variable substitutions.

.. note::

   We don't trigger email notifications or build status webhooks on :doc:`builds from pull requests </pull-requests>`.
