Read the Docs simplifies managing software documentation
by building and hosting your docs automatically,
using the Git workflow you already use for code.
Treating documentation like code lets your team use tools they already know,
and makes keeping your docs updated easier.

Up to date documentation
    Whenever you push code to Git,
    Read the Docs will automatically build your docs
    so your code and documentation are always up-to-date.
    Get started with our :doc:`tutorial </tutorial/index>`.

Documentation for every version
    Read the Docs can host multiple versions of your docs.
    Keep your 1.0 and 2.0 documentation online,
    pulled directly from Git.
    Start hosting all your :doc:`versions </versions>`.

Open source and user focused
    Our company is bootstrapped and 100% user-focused,
    so our product gets better for our users instead of our investors.
    |org_brand| hosts documentation for over 100,000 large
    and small open source projects at no cost.
    |com_brand| supports hundreds of organizations with product and internal documentation.
    Learn more about these differences on `our pricing page <https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/>`_.
