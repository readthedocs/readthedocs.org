`Read the Docs`_ simplifies software documentation
by building, versioning, and hosting of your docs, automatically.
This enables many "docs like code" workflows,
keeping your code & documentation as close as possible.

Never out of sync |:arrows_counterclockwise:|
    Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system,
    whether that is Git or Mercurial,
    Read the Docs will automatically build your docs
    so your code and documentation are always up-to-date.
    Read more about :doc:`/integrations`.

Multiple versions |:card_index_dividers:|
    Read the Docs can host and build multiple versions of your docs
    so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version
    of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
    Read more about :doc:`/versions`.

Open Source and User Focused |:heartbeat:|
    Our code is free and `open source <https://github.com/readthedocs/>`_.
    :doc:`Our company </about/index>` is bootstrapped and 100% user focused.
    |org_brand| hosts documentation for over 100,000 large
    and small open source projects,
    in almost every human and computer language.
    |com_brand| supports hundreds of organizations with product and internal documentation.
