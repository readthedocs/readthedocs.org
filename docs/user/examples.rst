We maintain an **Awesome List** where you can contribute new shiny examples of using Read the Docs. Please refer to the instructions on how to submit new entries on `Awesome Read the Docs Projects <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/>`_.


New example projects
--------------------

We would love to add more examples that showcase documentation options. We don't want your example project to break quickly, therefore we require that your example project...

* is **hosted and maintained *by you*** in its own Git repository, ``example-<topic>``
* uses a ``.readthedocs.yaml`` configuration
* has **continuous integration and PR builds**
* is **versioned** as a real software project
* is finally added to the above list by **opening a PR** targeting `examples.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/main/docs/user/examples.rst>`_

We **recommend** that your project...

* covers basic features, but references real-life projects whenever possible
* has a minimal tech stack -- or whatever you feel comfortable about maintaining
* copies from an existing example project as a template to get started
