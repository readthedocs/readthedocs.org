Notifications
=============

As part of the new :doc:`addons`, Read the Docs displays notifications in the following situations:

Pull request notification
    This notification warns users letting them know the documentation page they are reading comes from a pull request to clearly distinguish this version from the official one.

Non-stable notification
    A notification on all non-stable versions is shown to clearly communicate to readers they may be reading an outdated version of the documentation.

Latest version notification
    A notification shown on the latest version tells readers they are reading the latest/development version of the documentation that may include features not yet deployed.
