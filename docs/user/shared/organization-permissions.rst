Organization permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change your :doc:`Organization's </commercial/organizations>` settings,
you need to be an *owner* of that organization.

You can validate your ownership of the Organization with these steps:

1. Navigate to the `organization management page <https://app.readthedocs.com/organizations/choose/organization_detail/>`__.
2. Look at the :guilabel:`Owners` section on the right menu.

If you'd like to modify this setting and are not an owner,
you can ask an existing organization owner to take the actions listed.
