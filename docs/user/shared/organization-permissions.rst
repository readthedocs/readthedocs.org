Organization permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change your :doc:`Organization's </commercial/organizations>` settings,
you need to be an *owner* of that organization.

You can validate your ownership of the Organization with these steps:

* Navigate to :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Organizations` > :guilabel:`<Organization name>`
* Look at the :guilabel:`Owners` section on the right menu.

If you'd like to modify this setting and are not an owner,
you can ask an existing organization owner to take the actions listed.
