⏩️ :doc:`/tutorial/index`
  Documentation projects can use their own domain name.
  A project may define multiple domains,
  as well as define the *canonical domain* where all other domains will redirect.


⏩️ :doc:`/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx`
  We support multiple versions and translations,
  integrated nicely into the URL of your documentation.
  This is served at ``/en/latest/`` by default.
  If you only have 1 version and translation,
  we also support :doc:`single version projects </single-version>` served at ``/``.

⏩️ :doc:`/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs`
  Your project can be configured to build and host documentation for every new pull request.
  Previewing changes during review makes it easier to catch formatting and display issues.

⏩️ :doc:`/intro/import-guide`
  Build notifications can alert you when your builds fail so you can take immediate action.

⏩️ :doc:`/examples`
  Build notifications can alert you when your builds fail so you can take immediate action.
