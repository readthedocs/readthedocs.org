Public API (OpenAPI)
====================

Our public API is also documented as an OpenAPI specification so you can explore
and consume it programmatically.

.. note::

   Both community (``https://app.readthedocs.org``) and business
   (``https://app.readthedocs.com``) deployments expose the same endpoints.
   Authenticate with ``Authorization: Token <token>`` where required.

The complete specification is available below and can be downloaded from
:download:`openapi.yaml <openapi.yaml>`.
