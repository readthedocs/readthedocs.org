How to use traffic analytics
============================

This guide covers traffic analytics for your documentation project provided through Read the Docs Addons.

Traffic Analytics lets you see *which* documents your users are reading.
This allows you to understand how your documentation is being used,
so you can focus on expanding and updating parts people are reading most.

To see a list of the top pages from the last month,
go to the :guilabel:`Admin` tab of your project,
and then click on :guilabel:`Traffic Analytics`.

You can also access analytics data from :doc:`search results </guides/search-analytics>`.

.. note::

   The amount of analytics data stored for download depends which site you're using:

   * On the Community site, the last 90 days are stored.
   * On the Commercial one, it goes from 30 to infinite storage
      (check out `the pricing page <https://readthedocs.com/pricing/>`_).
