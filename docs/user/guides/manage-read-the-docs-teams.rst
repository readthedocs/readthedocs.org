How to manage Read the Docs teams
=================================

.. include:: /shared/admonition-rtd-business.rst

Read the Docs uses teams within an organization to group users and provide permissions to projects.
This guide will cover how to do team management,
including adding and removing people from teams.
You can read more about organizations and teams in our :doc:`/commercial/organizations` documentation.

Adding a user to a team
-----------------------

Adding a user to a team gives them all the permissions available to that team,
whether it's *read-only* or *admin*.
This can be done by:

* Navigating to :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Organizations` > :guilabel:`<Organization name>` > :guilabel:`Teams` > :guilabel:`<Team name>`
* Clicking :guilabel:`Invite Member`.
* Input the user's Read the Docs username or email address.
* Clicking :guilabel:`Add member`.

Removing a user from a team
----------------------------

Removing a user from a team removes all permissions that team gave them

* Navigating to :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Organizations` > :guilabel:`<Organization name>` > :guilabel:`Teams` > :guilabel:`<Team name>`
* Clicking :guilabel:`Remove` next to the user.


Grant access to users to import a project
-----------------------------------------

Make the user a member of any team with *admin* permissions,
they will be granted access to import a project on that team.

Automating this process
-----------------------

You can manage teams more easily using our :doc:`Single Sign-On </commercial/single-sign-on>` features.
