How to add a URL redirect (forward)
===================================

You can set up redirects for a project in your project dashboard's :guilabel:`Redirects` page.

* Go to the :guilabel:`Admin` tab of your project.
* From the left navigation menu, select :guilabel:`Redirects`.
* In the form box "Redirect Type" select the type of redirect you want.
  :ref:`See below <user-defined-redirects:redirect types>` for detail.
* Depending on the redirect type you select, enter ``From URL`` and/or ``To URL`` as needed.
* When finished, click the :guilabel:`Add` button.

Your redirects will be effective immediately.
