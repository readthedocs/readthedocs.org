How to connect your Read the Docs account to your Git repository
================================================================

In this how-to,
you are shown the steps to connect an account on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab with your Read the Docs account.
This is relevant if you have signed up for Read the Docs with your email
or if you have signed up with one Git provider and want to connect additional providers.

If you are going to import repositories from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab,
you should connect your Read the Docs account to your Git provider first.

.. note::

   If you signed up or logged in to Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab credentials,
   you're all done. Your account is connected ✅️.
   You only need this how-to if you want to connect additional Git providers.

To connect your Read the Docs account with a Git provider,
go to the main login menu: :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Settings` > :guilabel:`Connected Services`.

From here, you'll be able to connect to your GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab
account. This process will ask you to authorize an integration with Read the Docs.
