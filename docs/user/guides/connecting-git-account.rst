How to connect your Read the Docs account to your Git repository
================================================================

If you are going to import repositories from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab,
you should connect your Read the Docs account to your repository host first.

.. note::

   If you signed up or logged in to Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab credentials,
   you're all done. Your account is connected ✅️.

To connect a social account, go to your :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Settings` > :guilabel:`Connected Services`.

From here, you'll be able to connect to your GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab
account. This process will ask you to authorize a connection to Read the Docs,
that allows us to read information about and clone your repositories.
