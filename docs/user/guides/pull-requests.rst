How to configure pull request builds
====================================

In this section, you can learn how to configure :doc:`pull request builds </pull-requests>`.

To enable pull request builds for your project,
your Read the Docs account needs to be connected to an account with a supported Git provider.
See `Limitations`_ for more information.

If your account is already connected:

#. Go to your project dashboard
#. Go to :guilabel:`Admin`, then :guilabel:`Advanced settings`
#. Enable the :guilabel:`Build pull requests for this project` option
#. Click on :guilabel:`Save`

Privacy levels
--------------

.. note::

   Privacy levels are only supported on :doc:`/commercial/index`.

By default, all docs built from pull requests are private.
To change their privacy level:

#. Go to your project dashboard
#. Go to :guilabel:`Admin`, then :guilabel:`Advanced settings`
#. Select your option in :guilabel:`Privacy level of builds from pull requests`
#. Click on :guilabel:`Save`

Privacy levels work the same way as :ref:`normal versions <versions:privacy levels>`.

Limitations
-----------

- Only available for **GitHub** and **GitLab** currently. Bitbucket is not yet supported.
- To enable this feature, your Read the Docs account needs to be connected to an
  account with your Git provider.
- Builds from pull requests have the same memory and time limitations
  :doc:`as regular builds </builds>`.
- Additional formats like PDF and EPUB aren't built, to reduce build time.
- Search queries will default to the default experience for your tool.
  This is a feature we plan to add,
  but don't want to overwhelm our search indexes used in production.
- The built documentation is kept for 90 days after the pull request has been closed or merged.

Troubleshooting
---------------

No new builds are started when I open a pull request
   The most common cause is that your repository's webhook is not configured to
   send Read the Docs pull request events. You'll need to re-sync your project's
   webhook integration to reconfigure the Read the Docs webhook.

   To resync your project's webhook, go to your project's admin dashboard,
   :guilabel:`Integrations`, and then select the webhook integration for your
   provider. Follow the directions on to re-sync the webhook, or create a new
   webhook integration.

   You may also notice this behavior if your Read the Docs account is not
   connected to your Git provider account, or if it needs to be reconnected.
   You can (re)connect your account by going to your :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>`,
   :guilabel:`Settings`, then to :guilabel:`Connected Services`.


Build status is not being reported to your Git provider
   If opening a pull request does start a new build, but the build status is not
   being updated with your Git provider, then your connected account may have out
   dated or insufficient permisisons.

   Make sure that you have granted access to the Read the Docs `OAuth App`_ for
   your personal or organization GitHub account. You can also try reconnecting
   your account with your Git provider.
