Setting up outgoing webhooks
============================

When a project build is *triggered*, *successful* or *failed*,
Read the Docs can notify external APIs using outgoing :term:`webhooks <webhook>`.
These webhooks contain information about the build and build status
and can allow an external service to use this information for alerting,
monitoring, and many other custom configurations.

.. seealso::

    :doc:`/guides/build/email-notifications`
        Setup basic email notifications for build failures.

    :doc:`/pull-requests`
        Configure automated feedback and documentation site previews for your pull requests.

.. note::

   :doc:`Builds for pull requests </pull-requests>` do not trigger outgoing :term:`webhooks <webhook>`.

Creating a new webhook
----------------------

To create a new outgoing webhook for your project:

* Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Outgoing webhooks` in your project.
* Click :guilabel:`Add webhook`.
* Fill in the :guilabel:`URL` field with the target URL for your endpoint.
* Select the which events will trigger the webhook.
* Modify the :guilabel:`JSON payload` field or leave the default (see below for more).
* Click on :guilabel:`Add webhook`

Every time one of the selected events trigger,
Read the Docs will send a POST request to your webhook target URL.
The default payload will look like this:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "event": "build:triggered",
       "name": "docs",
       "slug": "docs",
       "version": "latest",
       "commit": "2552bb609ca46865dc36401dee0b1865a0aee52d",
       "build": "15173336",
       "start_date": "2021-11-03T16:23:14",
       "build_url": "https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/docs/builds/15173336/",
       "docs_url": "https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
   }

When a webhook is sent, a new entry will be added to the :guilabel:`Recent activity` list.
You can click on each entry to see the webhook request, response, and the request payload.

Custom payloads
---------------

You can customize the payload of the webhook to fit the expected structure of your target endpoint.
The payload structure must be valid JSON but can contain any of our
`payload variable substitutions <Payload variable reference>`_.

Variable substitutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following variable strings can be used in a custom payload to substitute information
about the build and project in the webhook body.

``{{ event }}``
  Event that triggered the webhook, one of ``build:triggered``, ``build:failed``, or ``build:passed``.

``{{ build.id }}``
  Build ID.

``{{ build.commit }}``
  Commit corresponding to the build, if present (otherwise ``""``).

``{{ build.url }}``
  URL of the build, for example ``https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/docs/builds/15173336/``.

``{{ build.docs_url }}``
  URL of the documentation corresponding to the build,
  for example ``https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/``.

``{{ build.start_date }}``
  Start date of the build (UTC, ISO format), for example ``2021-11-03T16:23:14``.

``{{ organization.name }}``
  Organization name (Commercial only).

``{{ organization.slug }}``
  Organization slug (Commercial only).

``{{ project.slug }}``
  Project slug.

``{{ project.name }}``
  Project name.

``{{ project.url }}``
  URL of the project :term:`dashboard`.

``{{ version.slug }}``
  Version slug.

``{{ version.name }}``
  Version name.

Verifying the payload
---------------------

After you add a new webhook, Read the Docs will generate a secret key for it
and use the key to generate a hash signature (HMAC-SHA256) for each payload.
This signature is included in the ``X-Hub-Signature`` header of each request.

.. figure:: /img/screenshots/community-project-webhook-secret.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center
   :alt: Webhook secret

   Webhook secret

We highly recommend using this signature
to verify that the webhook is coming from Read the Docs.
To do so, you can add some custom code on your server,
like this:

.. code-block:: python

   import hashlib
   import hmac
   import os


   def verify_signature(payload, request_headers):
       """
       Verify that the signature of payload is the same as the one coming from request_headers.
       """
       digest = hmac.new(
           key=os.environ["WEBHOOK_SECRET"].encode(),
           msg=payload.encode(),
           digestmod=hashlib.sha256,
       )
       expected_signature = digest.hexdigest()

       return hmac.compare_digest(
           request_headers["X-Hub-Signature"].encode(),
           expected_signature.encode(),
       )

Legacy webhooks
---------------

Webhooks created before the custom payloads functionality was added to Read the Docs
send a payload with the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "name": "Read the Docs",
       "slug": "rtd",
       "build": {
           "id": 6321373,
           "commit": "e8dd17a3f1627dd206d721e4be08ae6766fda40",
           "state": "finished",
           "success": false,
           "date": "2017-02-15 20:35:54"
       }
   }

To migrate to the new webhooks and keep a similar structure,
you can use this as the webhook custom payload:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "name": "{{ project.name }}",
       "slug": "{{ project.slug }}",
       "build": {
           "id": "{{ build.id }}",
           "commit": "{{ build.commit }}",
           "state": "{{ event }}",
           "date": "{{ build.start_date }}"
       }
   }

Troubleshooting webhooks and payload discovery
----------------------------------------------

You can use public tools to discover, inspect, and test outgoing webhooks.
These tools act as catch-all endpoints for HTTP requests
and respond with a 200 OK HTTP status code. You can use these payloads
to develop your webhook services. You should exercise caution when using
these tools as you might be sending sensitive data to external tools.

These public tools include:

`Beeceptor <https://beeceptor.com/webhook-integration/>`__
    Create a temporary HTTPS endpoint and inspect incoming payloads. It lets you
    respond custom response code or messages from named HTTP mock server.

`Webhook Tester <https://webhook-test.com/>`__
    Inspect and debug incoming payloads. It lets you inspect all incoming
    requests to itâ€™s URL/bucket.
