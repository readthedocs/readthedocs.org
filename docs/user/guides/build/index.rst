    Email notifications can alert you when your builds fail.
    This is the most simple way to monitor your documentation builds,
    it only requires you to switch it on.

⏩️ :doc:`Setup webhook notifications </guides/build/webhooks>`
    Webhook notifications can alert you when your builds fail so you can take immediate action.
    We show examples of how to use the webhooks on popular platforms like Slack and Discord.

⏩️ :doc:`Configuring pull request builds </guides/pull-requests>`
    Have your documentation built and access a preview for every :doc:`pull request builds </pull-requests>`.

⏩️ :doc:`Using custom environment variables </guides/environment-variables>`
    Extra environment variables, for instance secrets, may be needed in the build process and can be defined from the project's :term:`dashboard`.

⏩️ :doc:`Managing versions automatically </guides/automation-rules>`
    Automating your versioning on Read the Docs means you only have to handle your versioning logic in Git.
