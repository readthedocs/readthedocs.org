How-to guides: build process
============================

⏩️ :doc:`Set up email notifications </guides/build/email-notifications>`
    Email notifications can alert you when your builds fail.
    This is the most simple way to monitor your documentation builds.

⏩️ :doc:`/guides/build/webhooks`
    Outgoing webhooks can used to send updates on builds to other services.
    We show examples using webhooks to connect to popular platforms like Slack and Discord.

⏩️ :doc:`Configuring pull request builds </guides/pull-requests>`
    Have your documentation built and access a preview for every :doc:`pull request builds </pull-requests>`.

⏩️ :doc:`Using custom environment variables </guides/environment-variables>`
    Extra environment variables, for instance secrets, may be needed in the build process and can be defined from the project's :term:`dashboard`.

⏩️ :doc:`Managing versions automatically </guides/automation-rules>`
    Automating your versioning on Read the Docs means you only have to handle your versioning logic in Git.
    Learn how to define rules to automate creation of new versions on Read the Docs,
    entirely using your Git repository's version logic.
