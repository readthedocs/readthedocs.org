How to manage maintainers for your project
==========================================

|org_brand| allows you to manage maintainers for your projects.
Every project is configured with its own list of maintainers
who will all have admin privileges to the project,
so be careful when adding new maintainers.

When you add a maintainer to your project,
they will be invited to join the project as a maintainer.
They will receive an email notification with a link to accept the invitation,
and won't have access to the project until they accept the invitation.

Adding a maintainer
-------------------

Adding a maintainer gives them admin access to your project.

Follow these steps:

* Navigate to the :guilabel:`Settings` tab of your project.
* Under :guilabel:`Setup`, click on the :guilabel:`Maintainers` tab.
* Click the :guilabel:`Add maintainer` button.
* Fill out the form with the new maintainer's username or email address.
* Click :guilabel:`Invite`.

Removing a maintainer
---------------------

Removing a maintainer revokes their admin access to your project.

Follow these steps:

* Navigate to the :guilabel:`Settings` tab of your project.
* Under :guilabel:`Setup`, click on the :guilabel:`Maintainers` tab.
* Find the maintainer you want to remove in the list.
* Click the :guilabel:`Remove` button next to their name.
* Confirm the removal in the dialog that appears.
