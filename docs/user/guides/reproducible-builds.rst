How to create reproducible builds
=================================

Your documentation depends on a number of dependencies to be built.
If your docs don't have :term:`reproducible` builds,
an update in a dependency can break your builds when least expected,
or make your docs look different from your local version.
This guide will help you to keep your builds working over time,
so that you can focus on content.

   :depth: 3

Define OS and tool versions in the config file
----------------------------------------------

We recommend defining the explicit version of the OS and tool versions used to build your documentation
using the ``.readthedocs.yaml``.
This file file *provides you per version settings*,
and *those settings live in your Git repository*.

This allows you to validate changes using :doc:`pull requests </pull-requests>`,
and ensures that all your versions can be rebuilt from a reproducible configuration.


.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: .readthedocs.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5,7-8

   version: 2

   # Explicitly set the OS and Python versions
   build:
     os: "ubuntu-24.04"
     tools:
       nodejs: "20"
       python: "3.12"

Use a requirements file for Python dependencies
-----------------------------------------------

We recommend using a Pip :ref:`requirements file <pip:requirements-file-format>` or Conda :ref:`environment file <config-file/v2:conda.environment>` to :term:`pin <pinning>` Python dependencies.
This ensures that top-level dependencies and extensions don't change.

A configuration file with explicit dependencies looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: .readthedocs.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   # Explicitly set the version of Python and its requirements
   python:
     install:
       - requirements: docs/requirements.txt

.. code-block::
   :caption: docs/requirements.txt

   # Defining the exact version will make sure things don't break
   sphinx==5.3.0
   sphinx_rtd_theme==1.1.1
   sphinx-notfound-page==1.0.2

.. tip::

   Remember to update your docs' dependencies from time to time to get new improvements and fixes.
   It also makes it easy to manage in case a version reaches its end of support date.

Pin your transitive dependencies
--------------------------------

Once you have :term:`pinned <pinning>` your own dependencies,
the next things to worry about are the dependencies of your dependencies.
These are called *transitive dependencies*,
and they can upgrade without warning if you do not pin these packages as well.

We recommend `pip-tools`_ to help address this problem.
It allows you to specify a ``requirements.in`` file with your top-level dependencies,
and it generates a ``requirements.txt`` file with the full set of transitive dependencies pinned.
