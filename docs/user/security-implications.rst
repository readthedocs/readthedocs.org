Security considerations for documentation pages
===============================================

This article explains the security implications of documentation pages,
this doesn't apply to the main dashboard (readthedocs.org/readthedocs.com),
only to documentation pages (readthedocs.io, readthedocs-hosted.com, and custom domains).

Cross-origin requests
---------------------

Read the Docs allows `cross-origin requests`_ for documentation resources it serves.
However, internal and proxied APIs, typically found under the ``/_/`` path don't allow cross-origin requests.

To facilitate this, the following headers are added to all responses from documentation pages:

- ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *``
- ``Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS``

These headers allow cross-origin requests from any origin
and only allow the GET, HEAD and OPTIONS methods.
It's important to note that passing credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication)
in cross-origin requests is not allowed,
ensuring access to public resources only.

Having cross-origin requests enabled allows third-party websites to make use of files from your documentation (as long as they are public),
which allows various third-party integrations to work.

If needed, the ``Access-Control`` headers can be changed for your documentation pages by :doc:`contacting support </support>`.
**You are responsible for providing the correct values for these headers, and making sure they don't break your documentation pages.**

Cookies
-------

On |org_brand|, we don't use cookies, as all resources are public.

On |com_brand|, we use cookies to store user sessions.
These cookies are set when a user authenticates to access private documentation.
Session cookies have the ``SameSite`` attribute set to ``None``,
which allows them to be sent in cross-origin requests where allowed
(see :ref:`security-implications:Cross-origin requests`),
for example, when embedding private documentation pages in an iframe
(see :ref:`security-implications:Embedding documentation pages`).

Embedding documentation pages
-----------------------------

Embedding documentation pages in an iframe is allowed.
Read the Docs doesn't set the ``X-Frame-Options`` or ``Content-Security-Policy`` headers,
which means that the browser's default behavior is used.

Embedding private documentation pages in an iframe is possible,
but it requires users to be previously authenticated in the embedded domain.

It's important to note that embedding documentation pages in an iframe does not grant the parent page access the iframe's content.
Documentation pages serve static content only, and the exposed APIs are read-only,
making the exploitation of a clickjacking vulnerability very unlikely.

If needed, the ``X-Frame-Options`` and ``Content-Security-Policy`` headers can be set on your documentation pages by :doc:`contacting support </support>`.
**You are responsible for providing the correct values for these headers, and making sure they don't break your documentation pages.**
