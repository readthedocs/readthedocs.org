Account authentication methods
==============================

Read the Docs supports several authentication methods for creating an account and logging in.
The method you choose depends on your preferences and the security requirements of your organization.

These authentication methods are not mutually exclusive,
you can use multiple methods to access your account.

Email and password
------------------

You can create an account on Read the Docs using your email address and a password.
This method works well for individual users and small teams,
but it limits the functionality available to you.

VCS provider authentication
---------------------------

You can also create an account on Read the Docs using a VCS authentication provider: GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
This method is more secure and convenient than using an email and password,
and provides access to additional features like automatic repository syncing.

Two factor authentication
-------------------------

Read the Docs supports Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security on all authentication methods.
If you have 2FA enabled on your account, you will be prompted to enter a code
when logging in.
