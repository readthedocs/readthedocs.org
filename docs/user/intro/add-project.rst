This page takes you through the process of adding a documentation project to Read the Docs.
If you have :doc:`connected your Read the Docs account </guides/connecting-git-account>` to GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab you will be able to add your project automatically.
Otherwise, you will need to add it manually and perform some extra steps.

Automatically add your project
------------------------------

#. Go to your :term:`dashboard`.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Add project`.
#. Type the name of the respository you want to add and click on it.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Continue`.
#. Edit any of the pre-filled fields with information of the repository.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Next`.
#. Add a :term:`configuration file` to your repository if it's doesn't exist yet.
#. Click on :guilabel:`This file exists`.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/reference/git-integration`
      Your project will be automatically configured with a Git integration.
      Learn more about all the features enabled by that integration on this page.

Manually add your project
-------------------------

#. Go to your :term:`dashboard`.
