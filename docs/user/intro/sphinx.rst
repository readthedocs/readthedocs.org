   :description lang=en: Hosting Sphinx documentation on Read the Docs.

`Sphinx`_ is a powerful documentation generator that
has many features for writing technical documentation.
Sphinx is written in Python, and supports documentation written in reStructuredText and Markdown.

Minimal configuration required to build an existing Sphinx project on Read the Docs looks like this,
specifying a python 3.x toolchain on Ubuntu, using the built-in :ref:`mkdocs <config-file/v2:sphinx>` command,
and defining the location of the installation requirements:


.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: .readthedocs.yaml

      version: 2

      build:
         os: ubuntu-24.04
         tools:
            python: "3"

      sphinx:
         configuration: docs/conf.py

      python:
         install:
            - requirements: requirements.txt

Quick start
-----------

- If you have an existing Sphinx project you want to host on Read the Docs, check out our :doc:`/intro/add-project` guide.

- If you're new to Sphinx, check out the official `Getting started with Sphinx`_ guide.

- For a step by step tutorial on Read the Docs using an example Sphinx project, take a look at the :doc:`/tutorial/index`.

Configuring Sphinx and Read the Docs addons
-------------------------------------------

For optimal integration with Read the Docs, make the optional following configuration changes to your Spinx config.

.. contents::
   :depth: 1
   :local:
   :backlinks: none

Set the canonical URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :doc:`canonical URL </canonical-urls>` allows you to specify the preferred version of a web page
to prevent duplicated content.

Set your `html_baseurl`_  to your Read the Docs canonical URL using a
:doc:`Read the Docs environment variable </reference/environment-variables>`:

.. code-block:: py
    :caption: conf.py

    html_baseurl = os.environ.get("READTHEDOCS_CANONICAL_URL", "/")


.. _html_baseurl: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_baseurl

Configure Read the Docs search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using the `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__,
:doc:`Server side search </server-side-search/index>` already works out of the box.

If you're using a different theme, enable :doc:`Server side search </server-side-search/index>`:

#. Add a snippet of JavaScript:

   .. code-block:: js
      :caption: readthedocs.js


      // Trigger the Read the Docs Addons Search modal when clicking on "Search docs" input from the topnav.
      document.querySelector("[role='search'] input").addEventListener("focusin", () => {
         const event = new CustomEvent("readthedocs-search-show");
         document.dispatchEvent(event);
      });

#. Include it in your build:

    .. code-block:: py
        :caption: conf.py

         html_js_files = [
             "readthedocs.js",
         ]


.. TODO: adapt and uncomment this section.
   We've changed `flyout_display` to be `hidden` by default;
   If people want to use the integrated version of it, they should declare it as `attached`.
   However, as we have the version/language selectors now,
   we want to promote that more and keep the Addons flyout enabled by default.

   Integrate the Read the Docs version menu into your site navigation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If you're using the `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__, the :ref:`flyout-menu:Addons flyout menu` is already fully integrated.

   You *may* need to set `flyout_display` to `hidden <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring.html#confval-flyout_display>`_ in your ``conf.py`` so as not to display two identical menus:

   .. code-block:: py
      :caption: conf.py

       html_theme_options = {
           "flyout_display": "hidden",
       }

   If you're using a different theme, the flyout menu will display in the default bottom right side of your docs.

Using Markdown with Sphinx
--------------------------

You can use `Markdown using MyST`_ and reStructuredText in the same Sphinx project.
We support this natively on Read the Docs, and you can also use locally by installing ``myst-parser``:

.. prompt:: bash $

    pip install myst-parser

Then in your ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = ["myst_parser"]

You can now continue writing your docs in ``.md`` files and it will work with Sphinx.
