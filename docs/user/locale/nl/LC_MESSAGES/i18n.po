msgid "Making Strings Localizable"
msgstr ""

#: ../../i18n.rst:22
msgid ""
"Making strings in templates localizable is exceptionally easy. Making "
"strings in Python localizable is a little more complicated. The short "
"answer, though, is to just wrap the string in ``_()``."

msgid "Interpolation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../i18n.rst:30
msgid ""
"A string is often a combination of a fixed string and something changing, "
"for example, ``Welcome, James`` is a combination of the fixed part "
"``Welcome,``, and the changing part ``James``. The naive solution is to "
"localize the first part and then follow it with the name::"

"In some locales, the word order may be different. Use Python string "
"formatting to interpolate the changing part into the string::"

#: ../../i18n.rst:44

"Python gives you a lot of ways to interpolate strings. The best way is to "
"use Py3k formatting and kwargs. That's the clearest for localizers."

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it can help localizers to describe where a string comes from, "
"particularly if it can be difficult to find in the interface, or is not very"
" self-descriptive (e.g. very short strings). If you immediately precede the "
"string with a comment that starts with ``Translators:``, the comment will be"
" added to the PO file, and visible to localizers."

msgid "Adding Context with msgctxt"
msgstr ""

#: ../../i18n.rst:76
msgid ""
"Strings may be the same in English, but different in other languages. "
"English, for example, has no grammatical gender, and sometimes the noun and "
"verb forms of a word are identical."
msgstr ""

#: ../../i18n.rst:80
msgid ""
"To make it possible to localize these correctly, we can add \"context\" "
"(known in gettext as *msgctxt*) to differentiate two otherwise identical "
"strings. Django provides a :func:`~django.utils.translation.pgettext()` "
"function for this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../i18n.rst:84
msgid ""
"For example, the string *Search* may be a noun or a verb in English. In a "
"heading, it may be considered a noun, but on a button, it may be a verb. "
"It's appropriate to add a context (like *button*) to one of them."

"This method takes three arguments because English only needs three, i.e., "
"zero is considered \"plural\" for English. Other languages may have "
"`different plural rules "
"<http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/l10n/pluralforms>`_, and require "
"different phrases for, say 0, 1, 2-3, 4-10, >10. That's absolutely fine, and"

"In some situations, it's desirable to evaluate template expressions such as "
