"The primary method that Read the Docs uses to detect changes to your "
"documentation is through the use of *webhooks*. Webhooks are configured with"
" your repository provider, such as GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab, and with "
"each commit, merge, or other change to your repository, Read the Docs is "
"notified. When we receive a webhook notification, we determine if the change"
" is related to an active version for your project, and if it is, a build is "
"triggered for that version."
