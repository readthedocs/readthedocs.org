"This will serve as a list of all of the features that Read the Docs "

"The :doc:`webhooks` page talks about the different ways you can ping RTD to "
"let us know your project has been updated. We have official support for "
"GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab, and anywhere else we have a generic post-"

"find a list of available versions that we've inferred from the tags and "
"branches in your source control system (according to the support matrix "
"below). On the Versions page you can tell us which versions you'd like us to"
" build docs for, whether each should be public, protected, or private, and "
"what the default version should be (we'll redirect there when someone hits "
"your main project page, e.g., http://my-project.rtfd.org/)."
