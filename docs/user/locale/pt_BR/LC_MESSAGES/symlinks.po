"Read the Docs stays highly available by serving all documentation pages out "
"of nginx. This means that they never hit our Python layer, meaning that they"
" never hit our database. This reduces the total number of servers to serve a"
" request to 1, each of which is redundant."

"For subdomains, this is a simple lookup of the project slug, using the "
"subdomain portion of the request's hostname. This doesn't require symlinks, "
"but it shows the basic logic that we need to replicate."

"When a user navigates to ``http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/``, we know "
"that they want the pip documentation. So we simply serve them the "
"documentation:"

msgid ""
"The ``@fallback`` directive is hit when we don't find the proper file. This "
"will cause things to hit the Python backend, so that proper action can be "
"taken."

msgid "Custom domains"
msgstr ""

#: ../../symlinks.rst:52
msgid ""
"Custom domains add a bit of difficulty, because at the nginx layer we don't "
"know what documentation to serve. When someone requests "
"``http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/``, we can't look at the URL to know to "
"serve the ``fabric`` docs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../symlinks.rst:57
msgid ""
"This is where symlinks come in. When someone requests "
"``http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/`` the first time, it hits the Python "
"layer. In that Python layer we record that ``docs.fabfile.org`` points at "
"``fabric``. When we build the ``fabric`` docs, we create a symlink for all "
"domains that have pointed at ``fabric`` before."
msgstr ""

#: ../../symlinks.rst:64
msgid ""
"So, when we get a request for ``docs.fabfile.org`` in the future, we will be"
" able to serve it directly from nginx. In this example, $host would be "
"``docs.fabfile.org``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../symlinks.rst:78
msgid ""
"Notice that nowhere in the above path is the project's slug mentioned. It is"
" simply there in the symlink in the cnames directory, and the docs are "
"served from there."
