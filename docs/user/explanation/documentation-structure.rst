How to structure your documentation
===================================

Structuring your documentation is an important part of the authoring process.
It's important to think about the reader of the documentation,
since they are the primary user of documentation.

One of the largest benefits of a good structure is that it removes questions that keep authors from writing documentation.
Starting with a blank page is often the hardest part of documentation,
so anything we can do to remove this problem is a win.

Recommendations for process
---------------------------

In order to avoid starting with a blank page,
we recommend a simple process:

* Choose a structure for your documentation. We recommend `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ for this.
* Find a :doc:`example project </examples>` or template to start from.
* Start writing by filling in the structure.

This process helps you get started quickly,
and helps keep things consistent for the reader of your documentation.

Diátaxis
--------

The documentation you're reading is written using the Diátaxis framework.
It has four major parts as summarized by this image:

We recommend that you read more about Diátaxis in the `documentation <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ for it.

Explaining the structure to your users
-------------------------------------

One of the benefits of Diátaxis is that it's a well-known structure,
and users might already be familiar with it.
As long as you stick to the structure,
your users should be able to use existing experience to navigate.

Using the names that are defined (eg. Tutorials, Explanation) in a user-facing way also helps here.
