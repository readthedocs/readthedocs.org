Deep dive into Read the Docs
============================

In this section,
we explain some of the more specific or advanced concepts of writing documentation on Read the Docs.

⏩️ :doc:`/config-file/index`
    The lifecycle of a documentation project changes the content and the structure of the documentation.
    In addition to this,
    the whole configuration of a project also changes.
    In this article,
    we explain some of the fundamental purposes of having a configuration file.

⏩️ :doc:`/subprojects`
    Thinking about gathering several documentation projects under the same umbrella?
    This is a common need, and using *subprojects* is a flexible option that is recommended for most cases.

⏩️ :doc:`/localization`
    Learn more about multilingual documentation projects and how translation workflows are supported.

⏩️ :doc:`/downloadable-documentation`
    An introduction to adding downloadable files that can be read offline to your documentation and keep them versioned.

⏩️ :doc:`/environment-variables`
    Environment variables can be used to make your documentation builds flexible and easy to customize.
    This is a general introduction to environment variables on our platform, both pre-defined and custom environment variables.
