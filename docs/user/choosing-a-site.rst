Choosing Between Our Two Platforms
==================================

Users often ask what the differences are between |org_brand| and |com_brand|.

While many of our features are available on both of these platforms, there
are some key differences between our two platforms.

Read the Docs Community
-----------------------

|org_brand| is exclusively for hosting open source documentation. We support
open source communities by providing free documentation building and hosting
services, for projects of all sizes.

Important points:

* Open source project hosting is always free
* All documentation sites include advertising
* Only supports public VCS repositories
* All documentation is publicly accessible to the world
* Less build time and fewer build resources (memory & CPU)
* Email support included only for issues with our platform
* Documentation is organized by projects

Read the Docs for Business
--------------------------

|com_brand| is meant for companies and users who have more complex requirements
for their documentation project. This can include commercial projects with
private source code, projects that can only be viewed with authentication, and
even large scale projects that are publicly available.

Important points:

* Hosting plans require a paid subscription plan
* There is no advertising on documentation sites
* Allows importing private and public repositories from VCS
* Supports private versions that require authentication to view
* Supports team authentication, including SSO with Google, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
* More build time and more build resources (memory & CPU)
* Includes 24x5 email support, with 24x7 SLA support available
* Documentation is organized by organization, giving more control over permissions
