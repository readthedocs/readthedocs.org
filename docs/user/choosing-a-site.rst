Choosing a dedicated documentation platform
===========================================

Read the Docs is a *choice* that needs explanation and understanding.
The reasons behind choosing a dedicated platform for building and deploying your documentation is in fact our *vision* for Read the Docs.

At the same time, users often ask what the differences are between |org_brand| and |com_brand|.

Why choose a dedicated documentation platform?
----------------------------------------------

It's common to think that documentation is as simple as maintaining some content for a static website. Job done.
But once you get the full picture of how complex maintaining a documentation site is over time,
it will make sense to choose a platform that's based on decades of experience in operating documentation tools that have proven their value over the same span of time.

A very straight-forward way to understand Read the Docs is to look at our :doc:`feature reference </reference/features>`.
All these features ultimately sustain the life-cycle of a documentation project.

Differences between Community and Business
------------------------------------------

While many of our features are available on both of these platforms, there
are some key differences between our two platforms.
