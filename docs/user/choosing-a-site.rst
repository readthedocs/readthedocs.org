Choosing Between Our Two Sites
==============================

A question our users often have is what the difference is between |org_brand| and |com_brand|.
This page will lay out the functional and philosophical differences between the two sites,
which should help you choose which is a better fit for your organization.

The features available on both platforms are the same.
The primary difference is the audience and use cases that are supported.

Read the Docs Community
-----------------------

|org_brand| is meant for open source projects to use for documentation hosting.
This is great for user and developer documentation for your project.

Important points:

* All documentation sites have advertising
* Only supports public VCS repositories
* All documentation is publicly accessible to the world
* Less build time and fewer build resources (memory & CPU)
* Documentation is organized by projects

Read the Docs for Business
--------------------------

|com_brand| is meant for companies and users who have private documentation.
It works well for product documentation as well as internal docs for your developers.

Important points:

* No advertising
* Allows importing private and public repositories from VCS
* Supports private versions that only your organization or people you give access to can see
* More build time and more build resources (memory & CPU)
* Documentation is organized by organization, giving more control over permissions
