Link previews
=============

Link previews allows you to see the content of the link you are about to click when you hover over it.
This gives you the ability to quickly preview where a link points,
so you can keep your context while reading but learn more from other resources.

   Example of link previews addon

Link previews will only be generated for internal links--links that point to pages within your documentation site.
No link previews will be generated for links to external sites or links that appear outside of the primary content of the documentation page (eg. nav bars).

You can see an example of a link preview by hovering over the following link: :doc:`Addons </addons>`.

Enabling link previews
----------------------

#. Go to the new :term:`dashboard`.
#. Click on a project name.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Settings`, then in the left bar, go to :guilabel:`Addons`.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Link previews` and check :guilabel:`Enabled`.
#. Save your settings -- a rebuild of your project isn't required!

Troubleshooting link previews
-----------------------------

We perform some heuristic to detect the documentation tool used to generate the page based on its HTML structure.
This auto-detection may fail, resulting in the content rendered inside the popup being incorrect.
If you are experiencing this, you can specify the CSS selector for the main content in :guilabel:`Settings > Addons > Advanced`,
or you can `open an issue in the addons repository <https://github.com/readthedocs/addons>`_ so we improve our heuristic.

Link previews won't be generated if JavaScript is not enabled in your web browser or if all cookies are blocked.
