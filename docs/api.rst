Read the Docs Public API
=========================

We have a limited public API that is available for you to get data out of the site. This page will only show a few of the basic parts, please file a ticket or ping us on IRC (#readthedocs on `Freenode (chat.freenode.net) <http://webchat.freenode.net>`_) if you have feature requests.

This document covers the read-only API provided. We have plans to create a read/write API, so that you can easily automate interactions with your project.

In all of these examples, replace `pip` with your own project.

This will allow you to compare whether a certain version is the highest version of a specific project. The above query should return a `'is_highest': false` in the returned dictionary.
