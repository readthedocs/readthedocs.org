Building and Contributing to Documentation
==========================================

As one might expect,
the documentation for Read the Docs is built using Sphinx and hosted on Read the Docs.
The docs are kept in the ``docs/`` directory at the top of the source tree.

You can build the docs by installing ``Sphinx`` and running::

	# in the docs directory
	make html

Let us know if you have any questions or want to contribute to the documentation.
