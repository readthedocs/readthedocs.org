Read the Docs Team
==================

readthedocs.org is the largest open source documentation hosting service.
Today we:

* Serve over **55 million pages** of documentation a month
* Serve over **40 TB** of documentation a month
* Host over **80,000 open source projects** and support over **100,000 users**

Read the Docs is provided as a free service to the open source community,
and we hope to maintain a reliable and stable hosting platform for years to come.

Staff
-----

The members of the Staff work full time on the service,
and we are also honored to have several :ref:`external contributors <major-contributors>`.

We mainly fund our operations through :doc:`advertising </advertising/index>`
and corporate-hosted documentation with `Read the Docs for Business <https://readthedocs.com/>`_,
and we are supported by a number of generous :doc:`sponsors </sponsors>`.

Teams
~~~~~

* The **Backend Team** folks develop the Django code that powers the backend of the project.
* The members of the **Frontend Team** care about UX, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript,
  and they maintain the project UI as well as the Sphinx theme.
* As part of operating the site, members of the **Operations Team** maintain a 24/7 on-call rotation.
  This means that folks have to be available and have their phone in service.
* The members of the **Advocacy Team** spread the word about all the work we do,
  and seek to understand the users priorities and feedback.
* The **Support Team** helps our thousands of users using the service,
  addressing tasks like resetting passwords, enable experimental features, or troubleshooting build errors.
