Claiming existing project names
===============================

If you want to use a project name that's already being used, you may
be able to claim it.

If the project has viewable documentation, you'll need to contact the
project's owner to see if you can persuade them to release the project
to you.  It's possible (but probably unlikely) that they're be willing
to let you have the project if it isn't being used any more.

If the project doesn't have viewable documentation, it may be an
abandoned experiment of some sort.  You should try to contact the
project owner to see if they're willing to surrender the project.

If a project doesn't have have viewable documentation, is inactive, and you're
unable to reach the project owner, you can petition Read The Docs
support **volunteers** to free the project name for you by `creating a
support issue <https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/new>`_.

Support volunteers will use their judgment to evaluate the status of
the existing project. If they deem it to be abandoned, then they'll
rename it, so you can create a new project with the desired name.
