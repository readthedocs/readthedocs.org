    If you are having trouble building older versions of your Documentation, then you can <a href="{% url projects_upload_html project.slug %}">Upload a Zip file of HTML</a> instead. This is to support versions that may not build anymore with current Sphinx, or to support plugins and extensions that we may not have on our server.
