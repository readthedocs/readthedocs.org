Imported field on Conf

Creating docs:
* dynamically build docs based only on models
* figure out how the hell to do TOC
* preload project w/ "installation", "getting started"
* any ajax shiz we need to make the editor work / preview, etc
* how versioning fits into this -> probably diffs stored in json
* history etc
* django.contrib.comments for your projects or modeled out 'doc requests'?
